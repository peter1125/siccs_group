00:12:36 >> THANK YOU. 
00:12:38 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JODI WIDERCAN. 
00:12:48 >> GOOD MORNING, MAYOR EMANUEL AND COUNCIL. 
00:12:59 WARNING CHICAGO OF THE DOGS OF THE EXTREME HEAT, TO STAY INSIDE IN 
00:13:05 AIR-CONDITIONED HOMES OR COOLING CENTERS. 
00:13:08 CHICAGO THREE HORSE CARRIAGE COMPANIES FORCE THEIR BELOVED HORSES TO 
00:13:13 WORK AT 90 HEAT. 
00:13:16 IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT NEITHER THE HEAT INDEX OR HUMIDITY ARE 
00:13:21 TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. 
00:13:23 AND ALSO THE TEMPERATURE ARE DETERMINED ON NORTHERLY ISLAND WHICH IS 
00:13:28 A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN WHERE THE HORSES WALK AND WORK. 
00:13:32 THIS IS NOT JUST IN HUMANE, IT'S ILLEGAL AND IT HAPPENS OFTEN. 
00:13:38 JUST LIKE WE WITNESSED ON MEMORIAL DAY AND JUST LIKE WE WILL PROBABLY 
00:13:43 WITNESS THIS WEEKEND WHERE IT'S SUPPOSE TO BE IN THE 90s. 
00:13:48 HUMAN SERVICES ARE TASKED WITH THE JOB OF PROTECTING THESE ANIMALS 
00:13:52 BUT AGAIN THEY'RE FAILING. 
00:13:54 THEY HAD NO INVESTIGATORS OUT TO MAKE SURE THESE HORSES WERE NOT WORK 
00:13:59 INING 90 HEAT. 
00:14:02 I CALLED THE A.C. MULTIPLE TIMES TO SEE IF THEY WERE GOING TO SEND 
00:14:06 ANY INVESTIGATORS OUT AND I RECEIVED NO RETURN PHONE CALLS. 
00:14:11 REGARDING MY TWEETS, I DID RECEIVE SOME RETWEETS, BASICALLY TELLING 
00:14:17 ME, THAT THEY WILL INVESTIGATE THE CLAIMS AND IF THERE IS PROPER 
00:14:22 EVIDENCE, THE FINES WILL BE ISSUED. 
00:14:24 BUT IT DOES NOT MEATER, AFTER THE FACT, THE HORSES ARE NOT BEING 
00:14:27 PROTECTED. 
00:14:28 THIS IS NOT AND SHOULD NOT BE THE JOB OF CONCERNED CITIZENS. 
00:14:33 THE SIGNATURE TO POINT THAT NEITHER THE CITY OR POLICE AND NEITHER 
00:14:39 THE ANIMAL CONTROL ARE MEANT TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. 
00:14:44 I ASKED A COUPLE OF POLICE OFFICERS WHO SHOWED UP, THE DEGREES, THEY 
00:14:50 DID NOT SEND THE HORSES IN. 
00:14:56 THE CTBT HAD INFORMED ME THAT THE CARRIAGE COMPANIES HAD TRIED TO 
00:15:00 COME FLY, THAT HAD NOT TRIED TO COMPLY WITH THE LAWS OR SEND IN 
00:15:05 TESHLTIONZ THE CITY REQUESTED TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. 
00:15:08 SHE HAD ALSO TOLD ME THAT ALL SETTLEMENTS WERE OFF THE TABLE. 
00:15:14 BUT WE NOW KNOW THAT TWO OF THE CARRIAGE COMPANIES HAVE SETTLED AND 
00:15:18 I'M SURE THAT THEIR COMPANY WILL AS WELL. 
00:15:20 SO RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS BECOME WITH THE HUNDREDS OF 
00:15:25 CITATIONS AND FINES THAT WERE ACCOMPANYING THESE VIOLATIONS, NOT TO 
00:15:30 MENTION THE NUMEROUS VIOLATION THAT'S WE HAVE WITNESSED AND SENT TO 
00:15:36 THE CITY THAT HAVE YET TO BE ADDRESSED. 
00:15:39 WE DONOUGH THAT THE CARRIAGE COMPANIES ARE STILL WORKING THE HORSES 
00:15:44 AND WORK WHENING IT'S HOT. 
00:15:46 MYSELF AND OTHERS HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF HOURS DOCUMENTING. 
00:15:49 THANK YOU. 
00:15:50 >> THANK YOU. 
00:15:52 THE NEXT SPEAK CER BARBARA FRANCE. 
00:16:01 >> GOOD MORNING, MAYOR EMANUEL AND COUNCIL. 
00:16:12 I'M A TEACHER, I'M HERE TO TELL THAT YOU JUST IN THE LAST 11 WEEKS, 
00:16:21 DISTURBING HEADLINES, SPOOKED HORSE GOES THROUGH WINDOWS AND DIES. 
00:16:27 XOERS MAN KILLED IN JUNE 2018, HORSE HITS HEAD ON A CAR. 
00:16:38 STATE ZEN TAR ESCAPES INJURY IN CARRIAGE HORSE. 
00:16:44 HORSE SLIPS AND FALLS PULLING A CARRIAGE IN DOWNTOWN CHARLE STAN, MAY 
00:16:50 5, 2018, CARRIAGE HORSE BADLY INJURED AFTER CRASHING INTO A CAR IN 
00:16:56 MERCASH, APRIL 28, 2018, ANCHOR SPOOKED AGAIN AFTER A HORSE COLLAPSES. 
00:17:01 APRIL 25, 2018. 
00:17:04 CARRIAGE HORSE DIES AFTER A HEART ATTACK APRIL 17, 2018. 
00:17:11 AMERICAN COUPLE KILLED AFTER A HORSE DRAWN CARRIAGE CRASHES IN 
00:17:13 IRELAND. 
00:17:16 APRIL 10, 2018. 
00:17:17 THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE LIST. 
00:17:22 THESE ARE JUST THE CASUALTIES WE'RE AWARE OF. 
00:17:27 THERE ARE LIKELY MANY MORE HORSE CARRIAGES THAT DON'T MAKE THE PAPERS 
00:17:31 SINCE THE MEDIA AND CONCERNED CITIZENS ARE NOT ALWAYS AROUND TO WIT 
00:17:34 INCIDENTS. 
00:17:35 WE KNOW THAT KNEES INCIDENTS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO ONE REGION, CHICAGO 
00:17:42 HAS HAD FOUR ACCIDENTS SINCE 2014. 
00:17:45 THAT'S A LOT FOR AN ACTIVITY THAT IS UNNECESSARY. 
00:17:53 ESPECIALLY WHEN FOUR CHILDREN HAD TO BE RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL, 
00:17:56 LUCKILY THEY'RE OKAY. 
00:17:58 HOW MANY MORE DEATHS AND INJURIES MUST OCCUR SINCE CHICAGO MUST DO 
00:18:02 THE RIGHT THING. 
00:18:03 IT SHOULD BE AND BANS THE INCREDIBLY INHUMANE AND HIGHLY DANGEROUS 
00:18:06 RELIC. 
00:18:08 CHICAGO HAS ENOUGH PROBLEMS WITH CRIME AND OTHER ISSUES. 
00:18:11 WE CERTAINLY DON'T NEED A SIMILAR HEADLINE WITH TOURIST OR ANYONE FOR 
00:18:16 THAT MATTER, DIED DURING A HORSE CARRIAGE RIDE. 
00:18:20 LIKE THE 15,000 PLUS INDIVIDUALS AND 120 BUSINESSES AND THEIR 
00:18:24 THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS THAT HAVE ENDORSED A CHICAGO HORSE CARRIAGE 
00:18:27 BAN. 
00:18:30 PLEASE SUPPORT THE COMPASSIONATE MEASURE, INTRODUCED BY PAELD BRANDO 
00:18:36 NOT RYLEE, COSPONSORED BY HOPKINS LOPEZ AND COPPER MAN AND SUPPORTED 
00:18:46 BY MALD DONNA DO, SOLIS, SEESPOSADO.

00:20:24 EMANUEL, I'M HOLLERING, GEORGE. 
00:20:26 I'M HERE ON THE BEHALF OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY. 
00:20:30 MANY OF OUR BLACK PEOPLE ARE DISAPPOINTED WITH AMERICA. 
00:20:36 BRINGING ILLEGALS HERE, COMPETING WITH THE BLACK. 
00:20:43 ONLY ONE PEOPLE WAS ENSLAVED IN AMERICA AND IT WAS A BLACK SLAVE, 
00:20:49 EVERYONE ELSE CAME OVER BY GOOD. 
00:20:52 WE DESERVE THESE SERVICES AND BRING ANOTHER ILLEGAL GROUP IN THAT 
00:20:57 DOES NOT GO ALONG WITH THE CONSTITUTION OF OUR GREAT NATION, DO NOT 
00:21:04 GO THROUGH IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION, WHEN I SIGNED UP THEY SAY, 
00:21:11 MR. BLAITMOORE, DO NUMBER 4. 
00:21:13 I CANNOT FIT AND BE NUMBER ONE. 
00:21:15 I HAVE TO GO ACCORDING TO THE LAW.

00:21:33 COINCIDENCE, IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT I RESPOND GEORGE BLAIFMOORE.

00:22:31 >> SORRY. 
00:22:35 I'M MELVIN BAILEY. 
00:22:37 AND MR. MAYOR I WANT TO THANK YOU ABOUT ANNOUNCING ABOUT THE NEW 
00:22:40 AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM. 
00:22:42 BUT I WANT TO PIGGY BACK OFF THAT FOR A MINUTE AND THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN 
00:22:46 MY SPEECH AND MY ECHOING, WE NEED TO CREATE JOBS THROUGH AFFORDABLE 
00:22:52 HOUSING, THESE VACANT LOTS. 
00:22:54 BECAUSE IF WE KEEP THESE YOUNG MEN IN OUR COMMUNITY WORKING, THEY 
00:23:00 WOULDN'T BE OUT CAUSING NEGATIVE MEDIA AND NEGATIVE BEHAVIOR. 
00:23:05 BUT TYPICALLY MAYOR, I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THIS. 
00:23:10 WHEN PROGRAMS GET IMPLEMENTED IN OUR GRAM. 
00:23:17 WE NEVER FAOELT IMPACT IN THE PROGRAM SUCH AS THIS. 
00:23:20 NO JOBS, NO CONTRACTS, SO I WOULD LIKE FOR US TO LOOK IN THIS BODY TO 
00:23:25 LOOK CLOSELY ON HOW IT'S GOING TO CHANGE LIVES. 
00:23:27 AND HOW WE WILL BE EFFECTED, BECAUSE WE HAVE QUALIFIED "ERERS, 
00:23:36 QUALIFIED DEVELOPERS AND JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS SUCH AS MY HEART 
00:23:41 REDEMPTION PROJECT BEING THE 28th WARD. 
00:23:43 THESE GUYS ARE DOING AN EXCELLENT JOB IN TRAINING YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN 
00:23:48 IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADE. 
00:23:50 BUT WE WILL LOVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAIN. 
00:23:54 WHEN THEY TRAIN THEM, WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A TRAINING PROGRAM WITH 
00:23:57 NO JOBS. 
00:23:59 AND THAT'S A PROBLEM IN OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, THEY HAVE NO 
00:24:05 TRAINING JOBS. 
00:24:07 WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN TRAIN THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN TO 
00:24:11 MAKE SURE THEY ARE A PRODUCTIVE YOUNG MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY. 
00:24:17 AND MAYBESINGER I WOULD LIKE THO THANK ALDERMAN MITS THAT FOR THE 
00:24:26 PROJECTS THAT THAT IS COMING TO HER WARD. 
00:24:29 THE SHORT LIST OF CONTRACTORS, WE VETTED THEM AND WE SAID WITH THE 
00:24:34 CITY OF CHICAGO, WE NEED TO LOOK AT THESE GUYS BECAUSE TRADITIONALLY 
00:24:39 THEY DON'T HIRE AFRICAN AMERICA PEOPLE, THAT WOULD BE A DETRIMENT TO 
00:24:44 US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TURNOVER MILLIONS TO SOMEBODY THAT DOES NOT 
00:24:49 HIRE AFRICAN AMERICA. 
00:24:51 AND THANK YOU FOR ZACK, ZACK HAS BEEN VERY INSTRUMENT AL. 
00:24:58 I'M WORK WITHING MR. BOBBY SIMMONS, AND HIS ORGANIZATION, HE'S TRYING 
00:25:01 TO GET WITH THE LAW DEPARTMENT AND ALSO ZONING DEPARTMENT, BECAUSE HE 
00:25:07 IS HELPING NON FOR PROFIT AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, RAISE MONEY THAT 
00:25:12 TYPICALLY DON'T HAVE MONEY FOR THEIR ORGANIZATION. 
00:25:14 SO IF WE CAN MOVE THAT AGENDA FORWARD, I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. 
00:25:20 AND I WANT TO THANK THIS BODY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. 
00:25:26 AND WE'LL BE BACK. 
00:25:27 [APPLAUSE].

00:27:07 AND ALDERMAN SOLIS, AS WELL. 
00:27:08 [APPLAUSE] 
00:27:13 ALDERMAN MALDONADO THAT TODAY ARE LOOKING AT THE SITUATION AS WHAT IT 
00:27:17 IS, A HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION. 
00:27:19 OF COURSE WE'RE OUTRAGED AT WHAT TRUM SUBPOENA DOING TO THEIR 
00:27:22 CHILDREN AND MOTHERS AND FATHERS AT THE BORDER. 
00:27:24 WE HAVE 34 MEMBERS IN MY CHURCH WHICH WE HAVE ASSISTED IN THE PROCESS 
00:27:31 OF STEAK CREDIBLE FEAR AND APPLICATION FOR ASYLUM. 
00:27:36 MANY OF THESE ARE SEEK FAMILY REUNIFICATION WHICH WE SHOULD ALL 
00:27:41 SUPPORT. 
00:27:43 ARE THESE MOTHERS AND BABIES A THREAT TO THE U.S. AS THEY WAIT ON 
00:27:47 THEIR ASYLUM CLAIMS? 
00:27:49 NO THERE IS NO REASON TO DO WHAT THEY ARE DOING NOW, CRIMINALLY 
00:28:00 SEPARATED MIGRANTS AND TRAUMATIZING CHILDREN FROM THEIR MOTHER. 
00:28:06 IT'S THIS ZERO TRUMP POLICY THAT CAUSED. 
00:28:11 THE PRESIDENT MOBILIZED THE DARK FOESSER OF WHITE SUPREMACY. 
00:28:19 MEANWHILE, THEY HAVE CLOSEDED BOARD THROUGH TORTURE OF CHILDREN. 
00:28:25 THIS MUST BE STORNTIOND THE CHILDREN MUST BE REUNITED WITH THEIR 
00:28:28 PAINTSER IMMEDIATELY. 
00:28:31 IN ADDITION, THEY MOVE TO TRUNK ATE, THE PROCESS OF SEEKING ASYLUM 
00:28:38 MUST ALSO BE STOPPED. 
00:28:42 THE SOLUTION FOR THE CHALLENGES BORDER LIE ELSEWHERE SPECIFICALLY IN 
00:28:49 A DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE SIX 
00:28:53 PRIMARY COUNT RAOE,Z OF MEX ME, HONDURAS, GUATEMALA, EL SALVADOR, AND 
00:29:08 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC. 
00:29:11 THEY HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRAVELED AND TRAVEL DANGEROUS SWAYSSING. 
00:29:16 REAL SOLUTIONS DO NOT FIT INTO THE TRUMP AGENDA OF MAKING AMERICA

00:30:56 ICE. 
00:30:58 MYLE HUSBAND WAS TRAVELING IN HIS CAR, AND HE WAS STOPPED OVER FOR 
00:31:03 NOT HAVING HIS ID. 
00:31:05 THE OFFICER THEN ASKED HIM IF HE HAD PAPER. 
00:31:08 WE ALREADY KNOW BY HIM USING THAT STATEMENT AND QUESTION, I ALREADY 
00:31:12 KNOW THAT WAS RACIAL PROFILING. 
00:31:15 IT'S BEEN SIX YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN TRYING.

00:31:20 THERE IS NO WAY, I'M AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.

00:32:05 WE NEED TO STOPT DEPORTATION NOT ONLY AT THE BORDER OF THE AMERICAN 
00:32:08 CHILDREN. 
00:32:12 MY DAUGHTER TRIED TO COMMITTING SUICIDE.

00:32:20 GOOD NIGHT.

00:32:26 AND I'M HERE ASKING HELP FROM EVERYBODY. 
00:32:30 I'M AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. 
00:32:32 I'M AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, THE ONLY THING I DID WAS LOVE A MAN WHO DID 
00:32:37 NOT HAVE A DOCUMENT. 
00:32:38 THERE IS NO PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP AND WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT. 
00:32:44 NOW PLEASE, PRAY FOR THESE FAMILIES.

00:33:00 THIS IS WHY I'M HERE TO ASKING FOR ALDERMAN, TO HELP THESE FAMILIES. 
00:33:05 TO STOP THE SEPARATION AND ALSO BRING FAMILIES TOGETHER. 
00:33:09 THANK YOU. 
00:33:11 [APPLAUSE] 
00:33:13 >> THANK YOU. 
00:33:16 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS PASTOR ORTIZ. 
00:33:20 PASTOR ORTIZ? 
00:33:35 >> MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL, AND ALDERMAN MALDONADO WILL INTRODUCE 
00:33:48 A HEARING IN WHICH YOU WILL HAVE HEARING IN JULY AND WHICH I HOPE YOU 
00:33:51 TAKE SERIOUS. 
00:33:53 WHAT WE'RE ASKING THIS CITY COUNCIL IS TO PASS THIS RESOLUTION TO 
00:33:58 DISCUSS IT. 
00:34:00 TO RURJ THE U.S. CONGRESS WHEN THEY RECONVENE NEXT YEAR, HOPEFULLY A 
00:34:08 BETTER AND NEWER CONGRESS, TO LEGISLATIVELY ACCOMPLISH WHAT PRESIDENT 
00:34:11 OBAMA HAD DONE IN TERMS OF PROVIDING PROTECTION FOR PARENTS WITH 
00:34:15 CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY. 
00:34:17 WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROGRAM THAT OBAMA WAS CALLED DACA, CAN BE PASSED 
00:34:23 LEGISLATIVELY BY THIS NEW CONGRESS. 
00:34:26 WE BELIEVE THAT THE CAMPAIGN TO DO THAT WILL TAKE THE CITY COUNCILS 
00:34:31 THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY SO THAT WE'RE READY IN JANUARY. 
00:34:33 WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE BORDER IS A SIN. 
00:34:35 WE KNOW THAT. 
00:34:39 BUT FOR WHEN 2300 CHILDREN ARE DEPRIVED OF THEIR PARENTS AT THE 
00:34:43 BORDER, I WANT YOU TO SIGH THAT IN THE LAST YAE, 100,000 CHILDREN 
00:34:50 MOSTLY U.S. CITIZENS HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS IN THIS 
00:34:52 COUNTRY. 
00:34:53 SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO STAND FOR THEM. 
00:34:55 THERE ARE CHILDREN, THERE ARE NEIGHBORS, THEY GO TO SCHOOL WITH OUR 
00:34:58 KIDS. 
00:35:01 THEY'RE U.S. CITIZENS AND THEY'RE BEING DEPRIVED OF THE HUMAN RIGHT 
00:35:05 OF FAMILY. 
00:35:06 WE BELIEVE THAT THE TEMPORARY SOLUTION THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME TO, 
00:35:14 IS ONE THAT THIS PRESIDENT WILL NOT DO. 
00:35:17 BUT SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO THE CONGRESS OF THE STAU. ITS. 
00:35:21 SO THE MOVEMENT BEGINS TODAY. 
00:35:23 WE HOPE THAT YOU'LL TAKE THOSE PUBLIC HEARINGS SERIOUS LAOE. I 
00:35:27 BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO HUMAN RIGHT AND TAKE THE HUMAN SERIOUSLY. 
00:35:31 AND THAT THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL WILL DO ALL THAT IT CAN TO MOVE 
00:35:36 THIS MOVEMENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO URGE THE CONGRESS IN 2019, TO 
00:35:41 PASS THE RESOLUTION WHICH PROTECTS THE PARENTS UNDOCUMENTED PARENTS 
00:35:48 OF U.S. CITIZEN CHILDREN OR DACA CHILDREN FROM DEPORTATION. 
00:35:53 WE THANK YOU. 
00:35:54 >> THANK YOU. 
00:35:57 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS CLAIRE HEARTFIELD. 
00:36:07 >> GOOD MORNING. 
00:36:11 MY NAME IS CLAIRE HEARTFIELD AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE LEGAL WOMEN 
00:36:14 VOTERS OF CHICAGO. 
00:36:16 I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE ORDINANCE TO RENAME CONGRESS 
00:36:23 PARKWAY FOR THE JOURNALIST AND ACTIVIST IDA B WELLS. 
00:36:28 AND I WANT TO START BY THANKING ALDERMAN FOR THIS EFFORT. 
00:36:34 I HAVE LIVED IN CHICAGO MY WHOLE LIFE. 
00:36:36 WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL MY MOTHER USED TO TAKE ME AND MY SISTERS 
00:36:44 DOWNTOWN TO SEE BUCK HAMLE, AND I NOTICED THE STREETS, RUN OFF ONE 
00:36:50 THEN AND WASHINGTON DOWN TO BELLBO AND I ASKED MY MOM ABOUT THESE 
00:36:55 NAMES AND THAT EXPERIENCE BECAME PART OF MY EARLY HISTORY LESSONS. 
00:37:00 A PICTURE FORMED IN MY MIND OF ALL OF THESE MEN STANDING TOGETHER 
00:37:03 WITH A SNAP SHOT COMPLETE WITH FUNNY HATS AND POWDERED WIGS. 
00:37:08 I DIDN'T THINK TO MYSELF WHY ARE THERE NO WOMEN OR AFRICAN-AMERICAN 
00:37:13 NAMES UP TL. I TOOK IT AS A GIVEN THAT PEOPLE ON THESE SIGNS WERE THE 
00:37:18 PEOPLE THAT SHAPED OUR HISTORY. 
00:37:21 THE QUESTION HAS COME UP, HOW ABOUT A MONUMENT FOR IDA B WELLS AND I 
00:37:27 SUPPORT HER CHILDREN'S WORK TO COMMISSION A MONUMENT. 
00:37:31 BUT ONE DOES NOT CANCEL OUT THE NEED FOR OTHER. 
00:37:36 A MONUMENT WILL HON OR THE LIFE FOR THIS A MAZING WOMAN WHO WORKED 
00:37:41 TIRELESSLY FOR WOMEN'S RIGHT AND THIS IS A APPROPRIATE TIME FOR THIS 
00:37:43 HONOR. 
00:37:46 BUT A DOWNTOWN STREET NAMED AFTER HER DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND 
00:37:50 JUST AS IMPORTANT. 
00:37:51 IT IS ABOUT ALL OF US. 
00:37:54 IT WILL FILL A WHOLE IN THE STORY OF WHO WE TELL WHO WE ARE AS A 
00:38:01 CITY WHO WE ARE AS CHICAGOIANS. 
00:38:05 THE CITY COUNCIL HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD, TO SET AN EXAMPLE FOR 
00:38:10 THE NATION AND TO GIVE US THE PEOPLE OF CHICAGO, THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
00:38:14 KNOW AND BE PROUD OF OUR STORY. 
00:38:18 JUST THINK OF WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WILL INTERACT 
00:38:25 WITH IDA B WELLS EVERY DAY, PEOPLE RIDING THE NUMBER 6 BUS TO WORK. 
00:38:32 NEXT STOP, IDA B WELLS STOP. 
00:38:35 FRIENDS OUT FOR A NIGHT MUSIC, WILL SAY, LET'S MEET AT THE CORNER OF 
00:38:45 MICHIGAN AND IDA B WELLS DRIVE. 
00:38:49 FOR KNOWS LITTLE GIRLS AND BOYS WHO LIKE I DID, IMAGINE A SNAP SHOT 
00:38:55 OF OUR LEADERS STANDING NEXT TO THE WHITE MEN IN WIGS WILL BE THIS 
00:39:03 BROWN SKIN WOMAN. 
00:39:05 SXL TO ALL OF US, WE'LL TAKE IT AS A GIVEN, BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WHITE 
00:39:11 AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE IMPORTANT. 
00:39:12 >> THANK YOU. 
00:39:16 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JACKIE PAGE. 
00:39:23 >> GOOD MORNING, ALDERMAN AND MR. MAYOR. 
00:39:27 WHAT JUST HAPPENED IS INDICATIVE OF WHAT WHY CHICAGO HAS BEEN CALLED 
00:39:33 THE MOST CORRUPT CITY IN THE UNITED STATES. 
00:39:37 PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO FOLLOW DIFFERENT SETS OF RULES. 
00:39:42 ALL I'M SAYING, I FOLLOW THE RULES, EVERYONE SHOULD FOLT RULES. 
00:39:46 THAT'S WE'RE SAYING HERE. 
00:39:49 I LOVE MY BROWN BROTHERS, I HAVE NO HATE FOR YOU. 
00:39:53 BUT I'M SAYING, IF EVERYONE FOLLOWS THE RULES. 
00:39:56 THE REASON WHY GEORGE GETS UP HERE. 
00:39:58 IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN AND YOU TREAT ONE CHILD DIFFERENT FROM THE 
00:40:03 OTHER, THE CHILD YOU TREAT DIFFERENT IS GOING TO REACT AND SAY 
00:40:06 SOMETHING. 
00:40:08 PEOPLE ARE REACTING TO DIFFERENT TREATMENT. 
00:40:11 TREAT PEOPLE THE SAME, EVERYBODY FOLLOW THE SAME COURSE OF ACTION. 
00:40:16 IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING SET TO KEEP THE LAW, TO KEEP ORDER, WELL THEN, 
00:40:21 DO THAT THING THAT YOU PUT IN PLACE TO KEEP THE LAW AND TO KEEP ORDER. 
00:40:27 YOU CAN'T BRING THE LAW AND THEN TRY TO STAND ON IT. 
00:40:31 YOU WILL HAVE CHAOS. 
00:40:33 ALL I'M SAYING IS, LET'S FOLLOW ONE RULE OF ORDER. 
00:40:39 AND MR. MAYOR, YOU NEED PEOPLE AROUND THAT IS GOING TO HELP YOU TO 
00:40:43 BUILD THIS CITY. 
00:40:45 YOU HAVE PEOPLE AROUND YOU THAT ARE NOT HELPING YOU, THAT ARE HURTING 
00:40:47 YOU. 
00:40:51 THE TWHOEL QUAUL McdONALD THAT HAPPENED THAT IS PLAIN BAD AROUND THE 
00:40:56 WORLD IS BECAUSE OF THE COVER UP MORE SO BECAUSE OF THE CRIME. 
00:41:00 YOU NEED PEOPLE AROUND YOU THAT WILL HELP YOU BUILD THIS CITY. 
00:41:03 YOU HAVE PEOPLE AROUND YOU THAT IN ARE IN YOUR EAR THAT ARE NOT 
00:41:06 HELPING YOU. 
00:41:08 YOU HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE COMING HERE, THAT ARE TRYING TO GET YOUR 
00:41:12 ATTENTION BECAUSE THEY'RE HURTING. 
00:41:13 YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF SUMMIT WHERE YOU LISTEN TO THEM AND 
00:41:18 LISTEN TO THEIR ACHES AND PAINS. 
00:41:19 WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE DYING, BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT BEING LISTENED TO. 
00:41:24 IT'S ELECTION TIME. 
00:41:27 ON THIS ELECTION TIME POSTERING, IT WILL NOT WORK FOYER BECAUSE THE 
00:41:31 PAIN IS STILL IN EFFECT. 
00:41:32 AND AS LONG AS PEOPLE ARE HURTING, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PAY ATTENTION 
00:41:37 TO ANY PAIN AND TELL THEM THAT THEY HAVE A SOLUTION. 
00:41:40 ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE STILL NOT WORK. 
00:41:43 THEY'RE STILL NOT HOUSED. 
00:41:44 THOUGH YOU HAVE THIS HOUSING SOLUTION, YOU DID IT DURING ELECTION 
00:41:48 YEAR. 
00:41:49 I MEAN WILL YOU STILL DO THIS IF IT WAS NOT ELECTION TIME? 
00:41:57 WE NEED A MAYOR FOUR YEARS, OUT OF HIS ELECTION TIME. 
00:42:01 NOT JUST ONE. 
00:42:03 PAY ATTENTION TO US AND PAY ATTENTION TO BHA WE WANT AND NOT TO MONEY 
00:42:06 PEOPLE.

00:42:33 I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PASS ANDING SIGNING 
00:42:38 PETITIONS FOR A REFERENDUM FOR THE MAYOR OF CHICAGO. 
00:42:41 THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT BY THE PEOPLE OF ILLINOIS, IT WAS 
00:42:46 ESTABLISHED BY THE ILLINOIS CONSTITUTION. 
00:42:48 OUR SUPREME COURT AND INTERPRETING THE INITIATIVE POWER, HAD SAID 
00:42:52 THAT THIS IS A STATE CREATED FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE. 
00:42:55 TT CANNOT BE A BRIDGE BY ORDINANCE OR BY LEGISLATIVE RESTRICTION, 
00:43:00 THIS IS A RIGHT THAT IS RESERVED TO THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF OUR 
00:43:05 STATE INCLUDING CHICAGO. 
00:43:06 IN A CROSS A OUR COUNTRY, THERE ARE TEN CHARGE CITIES IN AMERICA. 
00:43:11 ONLY CHICAGO DOES NOT HAVE A TERM LIMIT ON THE MAYOR'S OFFICE. 
00:43:17 NEW YORK DOES, LOS ANGELES, HOUSTON, PHILADELPHIA, NOT CHICAGO, IT'S 
00:43:23 NEVER BEEN VOTED ON HERE. 
00:43:25 IN OUR STATE, 25 DIFFERENT CITIES, OAK KWAN, DISPLAINS, HAVE VOTED ON 
00:43:32 THIS VERY POWER THAT I JUST OUTLINED IN THE CONSTITUTION. 
00:43:38 WE'RE CONDUCTING A PETITION DRIVE TODAY. 
00:43:40 IT'S PROTECTED BY THE SUPREME COURT AND FOUR DECISIONS OF THE 
00:43:44 APPELLATE COURT IN THIS DISTRICT. 
00:43:46 THE COURT IS HELD IF PEOPLE HAVE THIS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. 
00:43:51 WE HAVE TO PROTECT THIS RIGHT AND VOTE ON A BINDING REFERENDUM. 
00:43:56 THIS IS NOT AN ADVISORY REFERENDUM. 
00:43:58 IT REQUEST NOT BE DENIED BY PASSING BY PASSING REFERENDUM BY THIS 
00:44:05 COUNSEL STILL OR ANY OTHER COUNCIL. 
00:44:07 SO I URGE YOU TODAY IN CONSIDERING THESE QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU, HOW 
00:44:11 ARE YOU GOING TO BE PERCEIVED BY YOUR VOTERS AND IN YOUR WARDS? 
00:44:15 ARE THEY GOING TO SEE YOU AS SINCERELY SUPPORTING SOMETHING OR TRYING 
00:44:19 TO STOP SOMETHING? 
00:44:21 THE ISSUE OF TERM LIMITS ON THE MAYOR, IS A CONTROVERSIAL ONE. 
00:44:25 THE MAYOR IS TERRIFIED OF THIS REFERENDUM. 
00:44:28 WE ALL KNOW THAT AND THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO KEEP IT OFF 
00:44:32 THE BALLOT. 
00:44:33 WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THEM DO THAT, WE'RE GOING TO ASSERT OUR RIGHT 
00:44:41 TO PASS PETITIONS AND GATHER SIGNATURES SO VOTERS CAN DECIDE IN THIS 
00:44:46 CITY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 181 YEARS WHETHER OR NOT A MAYOR SHOULD 
00:44:52 HAVE A TERM LIMIT. 
00:44:53 THEY ARE DOING IT IN OTHER CITIES AND WE SHOULD DO IT IN CHICAGO AND 
00:44:59 LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE THE LAW OF THE LAND.

01:10:29 ANNIVERSARY OF SPECIAL OLYMPICS. 
01:10:34 BY ADAPTING A RESOLUTION TO SPREAD UPON THE GENERAL PROCEEDINGS, THE 
01:10:42 FACT THAT EPIC, EVENT TOOK PLACE HERE IN CHICAGO ALMOST 50 YEARS AGO. 
01:10:54 THE LEGACY THAT MIKE HAS INHERITED OF LEADERSHIP AT THE CHICAGO PARK 
01:11:02 DISTRICT, IS ONE THAT IS UNPARALLEL AROUND THE NATION. 
01:11:10 WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 50 YEARS AGO NEXT MONTH, ON THAT STEAMY DAY, 
01:11:20 AT SOLDIER FIELD THAT THAT IDEA, THAT CONCEPT WOULD SPREAD TO 172 
01:11:28 NATIONS ALL AROUND THE WORLD AND OFFER MILLIONS OF YOUNGSTERS THE 
01:11:39 OPPORTUNITY TO ENJOY THE COMPETITION THAT SPORTS PROVIDE. 
01:11:46 IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THINKING BACK 50 YEARS AGO, HOW IGNORED, SPECIAL 
01:11:58 OLYMPIANS WERE. 
01:12:02 THEY HAD NO OPPORTUNITY FOR SPECIAL CLASSES, MANY TIMES THEIR 
01:12:14 CHALLENGES WERE FORCING THEM INTO THE BACK ROOM OF THE APARTMENT AND 
01:12:26 WHEN EUNICE DRIVER, SAID THOSE WORDS ON THAT DAY, LET ME WIN BUT IF I 
01:12:37 CANNOT WIN LET ME BE BRAVE IN THE ATTEMPT. 
01:12:40 IT WAS A PHRASE THAT WOULD GO ON TO RESOUND AND ECHO THROUGHOUT THE 
01:12:49 WORLD. 
01:12:52 I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO MENTION, ON TWO MEN. 
01:13:05 SPECIAL OLYMPICS, WOULD NOT EXIST TODAY. 
01:13:10 RICHARD J DAILY, THE MAYOR OF CHICAGO AT THAT TIME. 
01:13:20 AND WILLIAM McBETRAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF 
01:13:23 THE CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT. 
01:13:25 AND LIKE SO MANY OTHERS CHICAGO STORIES, THERE IS A BACK STORY FOR 
01:13:32 SPECIAL OLYMPICS. 
01:13:37 THE INTERNATIONAL HEAD OF OLYMPICS, WAS A MAN BY THE NAME OF AVERY 
01:13:44 BRUNN. 
01:13:46 HE WAS A CRUSTY PERSON WHO HAD BECOME THE HEAD OF INTERNATIONAL 
01:13:53 OLYMPICS. 
01:13:56 AND SEVERAL WEEKS BEFORE THE OLYMPICS SPECIAL OLYMPICS WERE TO TAKE 
01:14:04 PLACE IN SOLDIER FIELD, A LETTER ARRIVED FROM THE INTERNATIONAL 
01:14:13 OLYMPICS SIGNED BY AVERY BRUNTAGE. 
01:14:16 AND AVERY CHALLENGED THE PARK DISTRICT TO STOP PLANNING THE SPECIAL 
01:14:26 OLYMPIC GAMES BECAUSE HE CONTENDED AND THREATENED TO FILE A LAWSUIT 
01:14:31 THAT THEY WERE USING THE WORD OLYMPICS. 
01:14:36 AND HIS ORGANIZATION HAD EXCLUSIVE YOUTH AND RIGHTS TO THE TERM 
01:14:41 OLYMPICS. 
01:14:51 WELL, PHIL AND ANNE BURKE, OF COURSE WENT TO MAYOR DALEY'S OFFICE AND 
01:14:57 THEY EXPLAINED THAT THEY HAD 1,000 KIDS COMING FROM ALL OVER THE U.S. 
01:15:02 AND CANADA FOR THEY VENT. 
01:15:05 AND HERE THIS MR. BRUNTAGE WAS GOING TO STOP THEM, GET A COURT ORDER 
01:15:13 TO STOP THESE CHILDREN FROM PARTICIPATING IN THIS FIRST-EVER EVENT. 
01:15:20 SO AS THEY SAT IN THE MAYOR'S OFFICE, HE SAID TO HIS ASSISTANT, GET 
01:15:32 ME AVERY BRUNTAGE ON THE PHONE. 
01:15:35 NOW THEY COULD ONLY HEAR HIS HALF OF THE CONVERSATION BUT IT WENT 
01:15:39 SOMETHING LIKE THIS. 
01:15:45 AVERY, DICK DAILY HERE. 
01:15:47 I'VE GOT ANNE BURKE AND PHIL AND DAN SHANNON HERE IN THE OFFICE, AND 
01:15:52 THEY'RE TELLING ME THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SUE THEM SO THAT THESE KIDS 
01:15:56 THAT ARE GOING TO COME HERE TO SOLDIER FIELD ON JULY 20th, CAN'T 
01:16:04 PARTICIPATE IN THE FIRST-EVER GAMES. 
01:16:07 AND THEN THERE WAS SILENCE. 
01:16:09 AND THE MAYOR SAID, WELL I UNDERSTAND YOUR ARGUMENT AVERY, BUT YOU 
01:16:15 KNOW WHAT, I WAS WALKING THROUGH THE LOBBY OF THE LASALLE HOTEL JUST 
01:16:20 THE OTHER DAY, AND AVERY, YOU DO OWN THE LASALLE HOTEL, DON'T YOU? 
01:16:26 I WAS THINKING TO MYSELF, IF A SQUAD OF FIRE INSPECTORS AND BUILDING 
01:16:32 INSPECTORS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR HOTEL, YOU 
01:16:37 WOULDN'T BE TOO HAPPY. 
01:16:40 THERE WAS SILENCE. 
01:16:44 YES, AVERY, I'M PLEASED THAT YOU RECONSIDERED AND DECIDED NOT TO SUE 
01:16:50 THESE FOLKS AND THE GAMES CAN GO AHEAD. 
01:16:54 AND TO THIS DAY, THE ONLY ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD THAT CAN USE THAT 
01:17:00 TERM OLYMPICS IS THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS TO THIS VERY DAY. 
01:17:04 [APPLAUSE] 
01:17:09 IF IT WAS NOT FOR RICHARD J DAILY, PHIL, AND DAN SHANNON THAT DAY, 
01:17:19 MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BENEFIT FROMED SPECIAL 
01:17:24 OLYMPICS WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE. 
01:17:29 WHAT A GREAT LEGACY. 
01:17:31 THEY CAN PROCLAIM TO THE NATION AND TO THE WORLD. 
01:17:37 SO WHEN THAT ETERNAL FLAME IS LIT ON NEXT MONTH, IT'S GOING TO GET A 
01:17:46 VERY REAL SENSE WILL BE A TRIBUTE TO THE "I WILL" SPIRIT OF CHICAGO, 
01:17:54 THE MOST AMERICAN OF AMERICAN CITIES. 
01:17:56 THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:17:59 I URGE ALL THE MEMBERS TO CON CONGRATULATE MIKE KELLY OF THE CHICAGO 
01:18:08 DISTRICT FOR MAINTAINING THIS WONDERFUL AND INTERNATIONAL EVENT FOR 
01:18:14 THE LAST HALF CENTURY.

01:19:21 IT IS PROBABLY THE MOST FUN WEEKEND THAT EVERY EMPLOYEE HAS OVER AT

01:20:40 TOO BIG FOR HOMELESS SQUARE.

01:22:25 PARK. 
01:22:27 IT WAS A GREAT CELEBRATION. 
01:22:28 IT WAS GREAT TO SEE THE THRILL OF THE ATHLETES WHO ARE COMPETING 
01:22:33 THERE AND IT WAS A WONDERFUL EVENT. 
01:22:35 AND I KNOW THAT THINGS LIKE THIS JUST DON'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. 
01:22:40 SO I WANT TO CELEBRATE AND EN XAOURJ THE ATHLETES AND I WANT TO 
01:22:47 THANK, NOT ONLY JUSTICE BURKE FOR HER INITIATIVE EARLY ON AND 50 
01:22:56 YEARS AGO BUT THE PARK DISTRICT UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP, MIKE KELLY WHO 
01:23:03 CONTINUES WITH ENTHUSIASM WHO CELEBRATES THESE ATHLETES IN THE MANNER 
01:23:06 THAT THEY SHOULD BE CELEBRATED.

01:37:30 PRESENTED TO THE FAMILY OF AS A TOKEN OF OUR APPRECIATION. 
01:37:38 >> ALDERMAN BURKE. 
01:37:42 >> I MOVE TO -- 
01:37:45 ~>> HEARING NO OBJECTION SO ORDERED. 
01:37:48 >> IT'S SO IRONIC THAT FEBRUARY 28 THIS YEAR, MARRIAN BOLINI OUR 
01:38:01 FORMER COLLEAGUE CAME TO THIS HISTORIC CHAMBER TO WIT HER SON MICHAEL 
01:38:10 BEING HONORED BY THIS BODY. 
01:38:11 YOU KNOW, MR. PRESIDENT, IT WAS 30 YEARS TO THE DAY THE LAST TIME SHE 
01:38:20 WAS IN THIS CHAMBER. 
01:38:23 AND AS I SPOKE WITH HER RIGHT HERE, AT THE END OF THE MEETING, WE HAD 
01:38:30 AN OPPORTUNITY TO RELIVE SOME OF THOSE TIMES. 
01:38:37 SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES THAT WE SHARED IN WHAT MIGHT BE DESCRIBED AS 
01:38:46 ONE OF THE MOST TURBULENT POLITICAL EXPERIENCE IN THE HISTORY OF THIS 
01:38:53 GREAT CITY. 
01:38:55 SHE LOOKED SO GOOD, SHE WAS SO CHARMING AS SHE ALWAYS WAS. 
01:39:05 IT'S HARD TO REALIZE THAT NOW, JUST A FEW MONTHS LATER, WE'RE 
01:39:14 GATHERING TO COMMEMORATE HER LIFE AND EXPRESS OUR CONDOLENCES TO HER 
01:39:20 FAMILY. 
01:39:28 ALTHOUGH, MARRIAN CAME FROM A WORKING CLASS IRISH IMMIGRANT FAMILY AT 
01:39:38 St. RITA PARISH, I DIDN'T KNOW HER. 
01:39:41 AND EVEN THOUGH SHE WENT TO MARIA HIGH SCHOOL AS MY WIFE ANNE DID, 
01:39:48 SHE WAS A LITTLE BIT OLDER. 
01:39:50 SO SHE WAS MORE IN THE AGE GROUP OF MY LATE SISTER-IN-LAW PATSEY. 
01:40:00 IN THE FIRST TIME I EVER MET MARRIAN WAS WHEN SHE CAME TO THE CITY 
01:40:12 COUNCIL ALONG WITH KATHY AND THEY WERE CAMPAIGNING AGAINST THE DIRTY 
01:40:17 BOOK STORES. 
01:40:20 WE PASSED AN ORDINANCE THAT BELIEVE IT OR NOT, BECAME STANDARD FOR 
01:40:26 THE NATION. 
01:40:27 THE REASON THAT YOU DON'T SEE ANY MASSAGE PARLORS AND DIRTY BOOK 
01:40:34 STORES ALL AROUND THE CITY OF CHICAGO TODAY IS ONE WOULD SEE IN OTHER 
01:40:41 CITIES, IS BECAUSE KATHY AND MARRIAN TOOK UP THE CAUSE. 
01:40:48 THERE WERE ABOUT 70 DIRTY BOOK STORES AT THAT TIME. 
01:40:53 TODAY, THERE IS NONE. 
01:40:58 THAT WAS THEIR FIRST INTRODUCTION TO EFFECTIVE LOBBYING OF A 
01:41:06 LEGISLATIVE BODY. 
01:41:08 OF COURSE BOTH OF THEM WOULD GO ON TO DISTINGUISHED CAREERS AND 
01:41:18 GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS. 
01:41:22 BUT I WOULD SAY THAT BOTH OF THEM WOULD ALSO AGREE THAT THEIR MOST 
01:41:32 SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT IS TO HAVE BEEN THE PARENT OF WONDERFUL 
01:41:41 CHILDREN AND GRANDPARENTS OF WONDERFUL GRANDCHILDREN. 
01:41:46 THAT I THINK BOTH OF THEM WOULD BE THEIR MOST LASTING AND SIGNIFICANT 
01:41:53 LEGACY. 
01:41:57 I WAS VERY IMPRESSED AT THE FUNERAL AND LISTENED TO MONSIGNOR, THE 
01:42:10 FATHER JACK WALLS HOMILY WHICH REALLY INCAPSULIZED HER LIFE. 
01:42:20 SHE WAS A REMARKABLE PERSON. 
01:42:22 AND I KNOW THAT THE WONDERFUL LOVE THAT EXISTED WITH HER FAMILY, IS 
01:42:37 SOMETHING THAT COULD NOT BE REPLICATED. 
01:42:44 BUT YOUR HONOR, SHE'S NOW IN HEAVEN WITH HER LATE HUSBAND, CA MILO. 
01:42:50 AND WE CAN ONLY HOPE AND PRAY THAT WE COULD EXPERIENCE THE GREAT LIFE 
01:42:58 THAT MARRIAN DID. 
01:43:03 AND ADHERE THAT ETERNAL LIFE WITH HER SOME DAY. 
01:43:08 MAY SHE REST IN PEACE. 
01:43:11 I FEEL PRIVILEGED AND HONORED TO HAVE BEEN HER FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE. 
01:43:16 THANK YOU. 
01:43:17 >> ALDERMAN AUSTIN. 
01:43:23 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:43:24 I AM HONORED TO BE A PART OF THIS RESOLUTION FOR ALDERMAN BOLINI. 
01:43:33 I JUST WISH THAT BEFORE SHE RETIRED, THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN A PART OF 
01:43:39 A TEAM. 
01:43:44 BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES SHE CHAMPIONED SO WELL AND IN THIS COUNCIL MAKE 
01:43:50 US STAND UP AND TAKE NOTICE. 
01:44:00 THE YEARS SHE GAVE IS SOMETHING THAT HER FAMILY CAN BE PROUD OF. 
01:44:05 BECAUSE SHE WAS AN OUTSTANDING, INDIVIDUAL. 
01:44:08 OUTSTANDING MOTHER. 
01:44:10 I REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE GIVING YOU A SEND OFF HOW PROUD SHE WAS. 
01:44:15 BUT THAT WAS NOT JUST FOYER, IT WAS FOR US AS WELL. 
01:44:20 FOR THOSE THAT SHE HAD REPRESENTED ALL OF THOSE YEARS, FOR THE ONES 
01:44:24 THAT THEY HAD GIVEN TO US, I THANK YOU ON BEHALF ON THE 34th FOR 
01:44:31 ALLOWING US TO JUST TO KNOW HER. 
01:44:33 AS I WAS READING HER RESOLUTION, SHE WAS BORN IN NOVEMBER 1934, THAT 
01:44:40 WOULD MAKE ME A PART OF FAMILY FOR 34. 
01:44:49 BUT BEING A PART OF YOU MIKE, WAS PART OF YOUR MOM. 
01:44:53 AND WE CONTINUE TO PRAY. 
01:44:57 AS I SAID IN OUR ORGANIZATION, EARTH HAS NO SORROW THAT HEAVEN CANNOT 
01:45:01 HEAL. 
01:45:07 THIS TIME, WAS TRULY PASSED AWAY. 
01:45:10 >> THANK YOU. 
01:45:12 >> ALDERMAN O'CONNOR. 
01:45:14 >> THANK YOU MR. PR. AND COUNCIL. 
01:45:17 I TOO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. 
01:45:19 I AM ONE OF THE COUNCIL MEMBERS LEFT WHO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE 
01:45:26 WITH MARRIAN. 
01:45:29 I RECALL MIKE WHEN YOU WERE RETIRING WE WERE SPEAKING ABOUT YOUR 
01:45:39 VIRTUE, AND I TALKED ABOUT THOSE VIRTUE BECAUSE I KNEW WHERE YOU GOT 
01:45:43 THEM. 
01:45:45 I ALSO KNOW WHAT WE WERE TELLING YOU WHAT A GREAT PERSON SHE WAS, FOR 
01:45:51 TELLING YOU A NO. 
01:45:53 AND I KNOW NA WHEN AT THE WAKE AND THE CONSEQUENCES THAT WERE 
01:46:01 PASSION, I KNOW YOUR FAMILY PROBABLY HAD A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO 
01:46:04 TELL MOM STORIES. 
01:46:07 AND I JUST KNOW THAT, SHE SERVED A COMMUNITY AND AT THE SAME TIME, 
01:46:13 RAISED A FAMILY, AND THAT WAS NOT THE NORM ALL THE TIME. 
01:46:18 WHEN SHE WAS DOING IT. 
01:46:20 AND I THINK THAT NONE OF YOU GUYS WOULD HAVE--I THINK YOU ALL 
01:46:30 BENEFITED FROM HER INVOLVEMENT. 
01:46:31 AND I KNOW THAT THE CITY OF CHICK XHIK DID. 
01:46:35 --CHICAGO DID. 
01:46:37 IT'S AN HONOR FOR ME TO STAND AND COMMEMORATE WHAT SHE DID IN OUR 
01:46:44 CHAMBER AND THAT SHE DID IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. 
01:46:49 AND BECAUSE OF GEOGRAPHIC PROXIMITY, THAT WILL BE THE BENEFICIARY OF 
01:46:55 WHAT SHE SFARTED. 
01:46:57 I'M VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE KNOWN HER AND I WISH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY 
01:47:00 ALL THE BEST. 
01:47:02 >> ALDERMAN OSTERMAN. 
01:47:04 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:47:06 HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY TO REMEMBER AND RECOGNIZE THE MEMORY OF 
01:47:13 ALDERMAN MARRIAN KENNEDY VALINI. 
01:47:15 SHE WAS AN AMAZING WOMEN, AMAZING LEADER, A MAZING CHICAGOIAN. 
01:47:22 A TRAIL BLARES, A WOMAN WHO LIVED HER LIFE WITH VISION, STRENGTH, AND 
01:47:28 LOVE BUT ABOVE ALL ELSE, A WOMAN WHO LIVED HER LIFE IN SERVICE OF 
01:47:31 OTHERS. 
01:47:33 IN OUR COMMUNITY OF EDGEWATER IN THE 48th WARD, WHEN HISTORY IS 
01:47:38 WRITTEN, THERE IS CLEARLY A TIME BEFORE MARRIAN AND A TIME AFTER 
01:47:40 MARRIAN. 
01:47:42 BEFORE MARRIAN IN OUR COMMUNITY BOTH IN POLITICS AND VISION, THERE 
01:47:48 WAS LEADERSHIP THAT WAS LEAD DID I PEOPLE THAT CARED ABOUT PROFIT 
01:47:53 OVER COMMUNITY. 
01:47:55 WHAT MARRIAN DID IN POLITICS WAS TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER IN EVERY 
01:47:59 WALK OF LIFE WHO WANTED A BETTER NEIGHBORHOOD AND BETTER COMMUNITY 
01:48:02 AND GAVE THEM A SEAT AT THE TABLE. 
01:48:05 AND SHE FOIXED ON THINGS LIKE GROWING COMMUNITY, AND BUILDING BLOCK 
01:48:10 CLUBS AND NEIGHBORHOOD WATCHES AND IMPROVING OUR SCHOOLS AND ADDING 
01:48:14 SAFETY AND GIVING PEOPLE REAL POWER WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY. 
01:48:20 AND THAT LEVEL OF INCLUSIVE POLITICS LIVES OP TO THIS DAY AND IT'S 
01:48:25 SOMETHING THAT IS A LEGACY TO HER WORK AND WHAT SHE DID. 
01:48:29 THE PATH THAT SHE SET US ON IN THE 70s WHEN THINGS WERE INCAED A 
01:48:35 FWLAOE CHALLENGING AND DIFFICULT IS A TESTAMENT TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY 
01:48:38 AS A COMMUNITY. 
01:48:40 AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL LIVE ON WITH EVERYONE. 
01:48:45 I THINK OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE WEST SIDE ALDERMAN ERVIN, ALED 
01:48:58 MARRIAN WAS HANDS-ON DEALING WITH PROSTITUTION IN THE WEST SIDE. 
01:49:02 WELL BACK IN THE 70s, MARRIAN AND NEIGHBORS HAD POLAROID CAMERAS TO 
01:49:08 STOP PEOPLE COMING IN FOR PROSTITUTION AND DEAL WITH. 
01:49:12 SHE FORMED PEOPLE TO TURN THEIR LIGHTS ON ON THEIR FRONT PORCHES AND 
01:49:16 SHE DID LITTLE THINGS. 
01:49:18 BUT WHAT SHE DID, IT WAS NOT ABOUT HER, STHE IT BE ABOUT COMMUNITY. 
01:49:24 AND SHE BROUGHT PEOPLE TOGETHER. 
01:49:25 SHE WAS A WOMAN AND A LEADER FOR ALL, ALL CHICAGO AT A TIME WHERE WE 
01:49:32 HAVE A PRESENT WHO IS VILLE FYING AND MINORITY. 
01:49:42 MARRIAN WAS FOR JUSTICE FOR ALL. 
01:49:44 OUR COMMUNITY WAS FORMED IN THE WAKE OF VIETNAM WAR WITH THOUSANDS 
01:49:50 THAT CAME FROM EAST ASIAN. 
01:49:52 AND MARRIAN MADE SURE THAT THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE WELCOMED AND THAT 
01:49:56 SHE HAD THEIR BACK. 
01:49:58 AND SHE WORKED HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS THERE AND THE CITY 
01:50:03 GOVERNMENT WAS THERE FOR THEM. 
01:50:06 THAT OPENNESS ALSO LEAD TO GAY RIGHTS MEMBERS OF THE LGBT THAT ALWAYS 
01:50:13 FEMENT WELCOMED IN THE 48th WARD. 
01:50:16 MARRIAN WAS THE ONE THAT MADE THAT WELCOME WAGON BE OUT THERE. 
01:50:23 SHE WAS ALWAYS A FIERCE LEADER AND I GO BACK TO HER FAIRNESS AND 
01:50:27 JUSTICE. 
01:50:28 AT A TIME WHEN OUR CITY HAD GREAT RACIAL DIVISION. 
01:50:34 MARRIAN STOOD WITH HAROLD WASHINGTON AND MADE SURE THAT THE FIRST 
01:50:41 AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAYOR CITY OF CHICAGO HAD THE ABILITY TO GOVERNOR. 
01:50:45 AND SHE DID THAT NOT FOR POLITICS, NOT FOR SOME COMMITTEE 
01:50:52 CHAIRMANSHIP, SHE DID IT BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. SHE 
01:50:54 DID IT BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR THE CITY OF CHICAGO 
01:50:58 AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:51:01 IT'S FITTING TODAY THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS RESOLUTION AS WE SWEAR IN 
01:51:07 ANOTHER FEMALE ALDERMAN. 
01:51:09 IF YOU GO DOWNSTAIRS OR OUTSIDE THIS DOOR ON THE SECOND NRAO, THERE 
01:51:16 ARE DOZEN OF WOMEN ALDERMAN THAT SERVED IN THIS BODY, MARRIAN WAS THE 
01:51:20 7th. 
01:51:22 AND SHE WAS ALWAYS ENCOURAGING WOMEN TO RUN IN POLITICS. 
01:51:26 THAT'S ANOTHER LEGACY WITH ONE EXAMPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY, BUT SHE IS 
01:51:32 ALWAYS THERE TO ENCOURAGE WOMEN TO PRUN FOR OFFICE. 
01:51:36 IN HER LIFE AND WORK GO BEYOND HER TIME AS ALDERMAN WHICH WAS BRIEF. 
01:51:41 SHE WAS A BUSINESS LEADER, A COMMUNITY LEADER FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS 
01:51:45 THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON OTHER PEOPLE. 
01:51:50 MOST OF ALL, SHE WILL BE REMEMBERED HER KINDNESS TO OTHERS AND 
01:51:54 HELPING OTHERS. 
01:51:56 ALWAYS GRACIOUS, ALWAYS WONDERFUL SMILE. 
01:52:01 BUT HER LASTING LEGACY AS CHAIRMAN BURKE SAID, IS HER FAMILY. 
01:52:05 HER SONS, DAVID AND MICHAEL DAUGHTERS, MIMI, MARCY AND MONICA AND 
01:52:16 THEIR CHILDREN AND TO SEE THE WORK THAT THEY DO. 
01:52:19 I KNOW SHE LOOKS DOWN WITH HER HUSBAND AND MY MOTHER AND OTHERS, WITH 
01:52:24 GREAT PRIDE. 
01:52:26 SO AGAIN IT'S AN HONOR TORE NE TO RECOGNIZE AN INCREDIBLE CHICAGOIAN 
01:52:34 FOR HER LIFE WELL LIVED. 
01:52:38 >> ALDERMAN REBOGRAS. 
01:52:53 >> I HAD A PRESSURE TO WORK WITH HER AND RELEARNED A LOT FROM. 
01:52:59 JUST WANT TO SAY ON BEHALF MY CON STI OOH--CONSTITUENCE AND MY 
01:53:08 FAMILY, MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH HER FAMILY. 
01:53:10 AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE PERSONAL MESSAGE. 
01:53:14 I WILL ALWAYS KEEP THAT THANK YOU. 
01:53:16 >> ALDERMAN DAVID MOORE. 
01:53:19 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:53:22 I STAND IN SUPPORT AND IN MEMORY OF YOUR MOM. 
01:53:27 I CANNOT SIT UP HERE FRONT AND ACT LIKE I KNEW HER. 
01:53:33 THE ONLY THING I WRECK IS WHEN YOU WERE BEING HONORED WAS THAT SHE 
01:53:45 CAST THE VOTE FOR CHAIRMAN BURKE. 
01:53:48 WHAT I LEARN AND FROM SCRIPTURE, YOU CAN TELT TREE BIT FRUIT. 
01:53:55 AND MIE, I DON'T KNOW YOUR OTHER BROTHER AND SISTERS, BUT YOU HAVE 
01:54:03 REPRESENTED A MOTHER WELL. 
01:54:04 THAT'S THEIR LEGACY. 
01:54:06 HER BODY MAY NOT BE HERE WITH US, AND AS YOU KNOW, THERE IS A LOT OF 
01:54:13 BODIES AROUND THIS COUNCIL THAT IS DOING NOTHING THAT IS ALIVE. 
01:54:17 BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, HER LEGACY LIVES IN YOU. 
01:54:23 HER WORKS AND EVERYTHING THAT SHE STOOD FOR LIVES IN HER FAMILY. 
01:54:28 AND SO, WITH THAT SAID, I THANK HER FOR HER LIFE AND THAT IS SHOWN 
01:54:35 THROUGH YOU WHO I KNOW AND I'M SURE HER CHILDREN AND OTHER 
01:54:42 GRANDCHILDREN ARE GRIET EXAMPLES FOR HER AND YOU HAVE MY CONDOLENCES 
01:54:48 FOR YOUR MOM. 
01:54:50 THERE IS NOTHING LIKE A SXHOEFRMENT UNLESS SOMETHING LOST A MOTHER, 
01:54:54 AND EVEN IF YOU D EVERY RELATIONSHIP IS I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. 
01:55:05 I LIFT YOU ALL IN PRAYER. 
01:55:08 AND IN ASK GOD TO COMFORT YOU IN THOSE HOURS THAT YOU'RE THINKING 
01:55:10 ABOUT. 
01:55:16 HER BUT IN HER SPIRIT. 
01:55:22 >> ALDERMAN TUNNEY. 
01:55:23 >> I RISE IN SUPPORT. 
01:55:28 I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET ALDERMAN BOLINI. 
01:55:36 AND SHE WAS A GREAT PROMOTE OR OF THE STRIP THAT THEY TALK B.BUT 
01:55:46 TRUST ME THE RESURGENCE AND PARK STREET WAS IN NO SMALL PART. 
01:55:52 SHE OPENED THAT DOOR ON MARCH 15th, OF 87, AND THAT'S WHEN I MET 
01:56:01 ALDERMAN'S MOM AND OF COURSE MARRIAN SMITH WORKED TL. AND THIS WHOLE 
01:56:08 WOMEN LEADERSHIP WAS AWESOME FOR ME. 
01:56:10 AS THE REMARKS TALK ABOUT HER INCLUSION AND EARLY SUPPORT OF GAY 
01:56:20 RIGHTS MOVEMENT, WE AS THE GAY COMMUNITY, THERE WERE LIKE SINGLE 
01:56:24 DIGIT OF ALDERMAN THAT WERE SIGNING ON IN THE TIME SHE WAS. 
01:56:31 SO ANOTHER KIND OF STORY ABOUT WHEN YOU GOT UP TO ANDERSON BILL, I 
01:56:37 WAS AMAZED AT THE SUPPORT OF THE LESBIAN COMMUNITY IN ANDERSON BILL. 
01:56:42 I DIDN'T REALIZE. 
01:56:45 WE WENT UP THERE BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS SWEDISH. 
01:56:48 I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS SUPPORT IN LESBIAN. 
01:56:52 SO ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF THAT I WAS THERE, MY FRIENDS FROM WOMEN 
01:56:58 AND CHILDREN FIRST CAME TO ME AND SAID HOW IS IT IN ANDERSON BILL. 
01:57:06 WE'RE MOVING AND--SHE SAID, I TOLD HER, OH MY GOD, IT'S JUST A 
01:57:13 MAZING, THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT FROM THE WOMEN'S COMMUNITY UP IN 
01:57:18 ANDERSONVILLE. 
01:57:21 AND LO AND BEHOLD, THEY OPENED PRETTY CLOSE TO US ON CLARK STREET AND 
01:57:29 THEY'VE BEEN PHENOMENAL SUCCESS. 
01:57:32 SO BEING SAID, WE WERE CLOSING ANDERSON BILL AND I KNOW I GOT A LOST 
01:57:39 CRITICISM FOR IT, BUT ANYWAYS, SHE ACTUALLY LEAD US TO OUR GATHERS IN 
01:57:48 GRANDVILLE AND BROADWAY AND WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT GRANDVILLE 
01:57:52 AND BROADWAY WOULD BE WHERE IT'S AT TODAY. 
01:57:55 NOT ONLY DO I APPRECIATE HER AS AN ALDERMAN BUT, HOW MUCH SHE WAS AN 
01:58:01 ADVOCATE FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT HARRY HAS TALKED ABOUT. 
01:58:04 BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT WAS HER DEMEANER, IT WAS HER 
01:58:10 PERSONALITY, IT WAS HER ENTHUSIASM FOR HER COMMUNITY THAT WILL SHINE 
01:58:15 FOR MANY MANY YEARS. 
01:58:16 SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SHARING, MARRIAN WITH US AND SOME OF THE 
01:58:21 STORIES THAT I PERSONALLY HAD THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ALDERMAN 
01:58:25 BUT EVERYTHING WILL BUILDING COMMUNITY. 
01:58:26 SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
01:58:27 THANK YOU. 
01:58:29 >> ALDERMAN ROSADO. 
01:58:31 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:58:37 MIKE, SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. 
01:58:45 MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE FAR DOES NOT FALL TOO FAR--THE APPLE DOES NOT 
01:58:52 FAR TOO FAR FROM THE TREE. 
01:58:53 THANK YOU. 
01:58:55 >> GIVEN THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER ALDERMAN. 
01:58:59 OH, ALDERMAN MOORE. 
01:59:01 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:59:04 >> I SPOKE TOO SOON. 
01:59:11 >> I JUST SERVING WITH YOUR MOM BY ABOUT THREE YEARS. 
01:59:17 SO I NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE WITH HER, BUT I DID, FIRST, 
01:59:25 BECAUSE AT THE TIME OF HER TEN-YEAR, I WAS WORKING IN CITY LAW 
01:59:32 DEPARTMENTS ADJACENT TO THE LEGAL DIVISION. 
01:59:39 AND ALSO AS AN ACTIVIST OF ROGER PARK COMMUNITY. 
01:59:42 YOUR NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH. 
01:59:44 FIRST IN SERVICE IN THE COUNCIL, YOU KNOW, ALDERMAN BURKE, RELAYED 
01:59:50 THAT THOSE WERE ACRIMONYOUS TIMES. 
02:00:04 ONE THING THAT HE NEVER MADE IT PERSONAL. 
02:00:07 FOR HER, IT WAS STOOD BY YOUR PRINCIPALS. 
02:00:12 AND I MUST SAY, I'M ALWAYS VERY IMPRESSED BY THE FACT THAT YOU STOOD 
02:00:17 BY MAYOR WASHINGTON EVEN THOUGH HE REPRESENTED A WARD THAT HE DID NOT 
02:00:20 CARRY. 
02:00:24 AND REPRESENTED A WARD THAT WAS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE AT THE TIME. 
02:00:29 AND I THINK SHE BELIEVED THAT HIS ELECTION AND HIS SERVICE WAS AN 
02:00:33 IMPORTANT STEP FOR THE CITY. 
02:00:36 AND HIS EFFORT TO PERFORM CITY GOVERNMENT WERE IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT. 
02:00:42 SO SHE STOOD BY THOSE PRINCIPLES, SOMETHING I WAS ALWAYS IMPRESSED BY. 
02:00:49 BUT I WAS ALSO IMPRESSED BY THE EDGEWATER COMMUNITY MADE. 
02:00:54 ALDERMAN NOT ONLY SERVED IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT WE'RE ESSENTIALLY 
02:00:58 EXECUTIVES OF OUR COMMUNITY. 
02:01:00 MAYORS OF OUR SMALL CITIES IF YOU WILL. 
02:01:05 AND UNDER, HER LEADERSHIP, EDGEWATER REALLY BLOOMED. 
02:01:10 AND A LOT OF THE PROGRESS THAT THE EDGEWATER COMMUNITY AND ROGER'S 
02:01:16 WHACKER COMMUNITY HAVE ENJOYED WAS RESULT OF THE SEED THAT SHE 
02:01:19 PLANTED. 
02:01:25 SO I EXPRESS MY SINCERE CONDOLENCES ON YOUR LOSS, BUT BE COMFORTED 
02:01:31 BIT FACT THAT THERE IS MANY MANY PEOPLE WHO ADMIRED YOUR MOTHER AND 
02:01:37 EMULATED YOUR MOTHER AND WILL MISS YOUR MOTHER. 
02:01:45 >> I DO WANT TO SAY, WE SHARED A LOT OF STORIES AT THE WAKE. 
02:01:50 AND HOURS THAT WE CAN HAVE MORE STORIES OF THE WAY SHE HAS TOUCHED 
02:01:56 INDIVIDUALS IN DIFFERENT PARTS NOT JUST THE COMMUNITY SHE REPRESENTED 
02:01:59 BUT THE CITY SHE SERVED. 
02:02:01 I DO WANT TO SAY, WHILE WE'RE HERE TO PAY TRIBUTE TO HER TIME IS 
02:02:07 WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT EVERYONE ONE OF YOU OF THE SPIRIT OF PUBLIC 
02:02:10 SERVICE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF IT. 
02:02:13 AND THAT WILL BE BEYOND ON THE 48th WARD, YOU'LL BE ASKED TO HAVE A 
02:02:18 LASTING LEGACY. 
02:02:19 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO HELP IMPROVE SOMEBODY 
02:02:22 ELSE'S LIFE. 
02:02:23 AND ALL OF YOU IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, TAKE THAT SPIRIT AND TAKE THAT 
02:02:30 ENERGY SERIOUSLY, AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE FAMILY FOR SERVING THE 
02:02:33 CITY OF CHICAGO. 
02:02:35 ALDERMAN BURKE? 
02:02:37 >> MR. PRESIDENT IF NOBODY ELSE WISHES TO BE HEARD I MOVE FOR THE 
02:02:43 ADOPTION OF THE -- 
02:02:49 ~>> PLEASE RISE. 
02:03:14 [APPLAUSE]

02:04:50 ALDERMAN REBOYAS AND--WE'RE HERE TO MOURN THE DEATH OF A FRAOU 
02:04:53 CHICAGO HERO, JOUN OF THE CHICK XHIK FIRE DEPARTMENT PERISHED IN THE

02:05:16 --FALL OFF.

02:05:21 9-1-1. 
02:05:25 UPON ARRIVAL, TWO DIVERS JUMPED INTO THE RIVER FROM A HELICOPTER. 
02:05:28 ONE OF THOSE DIVERS WAS JUAN, AND WHERE AS BOTH DIVERS PERFORMED AN 
02:05:35 EXHAUSTED SEARCH WHERE THE VICTIM HAD FALLEN. 
02:05:38 AND WHERE A BOAT APPROACHED THE DIVERS, TO ALLOW THEM TO REST, MR. 
02:05:46 BUSTIO ENDED UP UNDERNEATH THE BOW HE WAS TAKEN TO HOSPITAL AND 
02:05:55 EFFORTS WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. 
02:05:56 AND WHILE A LIFE GABBEDSINGER WHICH WAS A 15-YEAR VETERAN AND DIVING 
02:06:01 IN THE DIVING UNIT SINCE 2007. 
02:06:05 HE HAD PREVIOUSLY SERVED IN THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT AND WHERE 
02:06:14 DIVER DISPLAYED A COURAGE TO DIVE INTO DANINGER THAT MOST US CANNOT 
02:06:16 IMAGINE. 
02:06:19 HIS DEDICATION TO PUBLIC SERVICE ARE EMBLEM ATIC OF OUR WORLD 
02:06:25 CLASSIFIER DEPARTMENT. 
02:06:29 THIS SHOWS HOW DANGEROUS THE WORK IS AND HOW FORTUNATE WE ARE PEOPLE 
02:06:38 LIKE JUAN BUSTIO PROTECT US EACH DAI. HE IS SURVIVED BY HIS LOVING 
02:06:44 WIFE SONIA AND TWO LOVING BOYS. 
02:06:46 AND WHILE HE WILL BE MISSED BY MANY OTHER LONG RELATIVES REGARDING 
02:06:51 FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES, WE'LL NEVER FORGET HIS COMPANION AND SPIRIT. 
02:06:56 NOW IT BE RESOLVED THAT WE THE MAYOR AND MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL 
02:07:01 CITY OF CHICAGO ASSEMBLE THIS 27th DAY OF JUNE, DO HEAR BY HONOR 
02:07:06 CHICAGO FIRE DEPARTMENT, DIVER, JUAN BUSTIO FOR HIS VA LOR AND 
02:07:13 SACRIFICE. 
02:07:16 AND TB FURTHER RESOLVED THAT THE COPY OF THIS RESOLUTION BE PRESENTED 
02:07:21 TO THE FAMILY OF JUAN BUSTIO AS A TOKEN OF OUR GRATITUDE. 
02:07:28 >> ALDERMAN BURKE. 
02:07:29 >> I MOVE TO SUSPENSION OF THE RULES FOR THIS RESOLUTION. 
02:07:33 >> HEARING NO OBJECTION, SO ORDERED. 
02:07:35 >> YOUR HONOR AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THIS COUNCIL. 
02:07:39 ON THIS SOLEMN DAY OF REMEMBRANCE, WE GATHER FUFL SORROW FOR THE LOSS 
02:07:48 OF GALLANT AND HEROIC CHICAGO FIRE FIGHTER, A MAFN FAITH, A MAN OF 
02:07:54 COURAGE, PERISHED IN THE LINE OF DUTY. 
02:08:00 A GOOD FATHER, DEVOTED FAMILY MAN AND A DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANT. 
02:08:09 JUAN BUSIO OF ENGINE 13 LEAVES TWO BOYS, SERVICE THAT WILL REMAIN 
02:08:20 ETCHED IN SERVICE. 
02:08:23 BEHIND THAT UNIFORM, WAS A MAN OF DETERMINATION, FEARLESSNESS, WHO 
02:08:30 PERFORMED ONE OF THE MOST HAZARDOUS DUTIES THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT 
02:08:37 COULD ASSIGN TO A MEMBER, UNDER WATER RESCUE. 
02:08:46 IT REQUIRES UNUSUAL COURAGE, QUICK THINKING, NERVES OF STEEL TO 
02:08:51 PLUNGE UNDER DARK WATERS OF A CANAL TO RESCUE A DROWNING VICTIM. 
02:08:59 IT'S CLEAR THE DANGERS ARE MANY AND THE BALANCE FOR BOTH THE FIRE 
02:09:06 FIGHTER AND THE VICTIM. 
02:09:09 BUT EACH DAY, FIRE FIGHTER JUAN BUSIO CONFRONTED THE DANGERS LIKE 
02:09:19 THAT WITH A SINGULARITY OF PURPOSE REGARDLESS OF THE RISK INVOLVED. 
02:09:28 SO THAT HE COULD LIKE THE OTHER BRAVE MEMBERS OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, 
02:09:32 RENDER TO OUR CITIES AND ITS RESIDENTS, AN INDISPENSABLE SERVICE. 
02:09:42 DAILY WORK OF KEEPING OUR CITIZENS FROM HARM. 
02:09:46 AND IN THIS AFTERNOON IN THIS HISTORIC CHAMBER, WE GATHER WITH HIS 
02:09:53 FAMILY MEMBERS AND COLLEAGUES TO REMEMBER AND REFLECT, TO HONOR THE 
02:09:59 LIFE OF A MAN WHO SERVED HIS PROFESSION SO NOBLELY AND A HIGHER 
02:10:11 PURPOSE. 
02:10:13 JUAN HAS NOW BEEN CALLED TO GAD BUT HIS IDEALS AND DEEPLY HELD 
02:10:19 VALUES, HIS COURAGE, HIS STRENGTH, HIS LOVE FOR FAMILY, WILL LIVE ON 
02:10:24 IN THEIR HEARTS. 
02:10:27 THE MAYOR AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL HAVE ALL TOO OFTEN JOINED IN 
02:10:36 RESOLUTIONS LIKE THIS. 
02:10:40 AND WE FALL TOO OFTEN IN THE GRIEF OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS. 
02:10:48 WE WOULD HOPE THAT ALL OF THE CITIES CITIZENS WOULD KEEP HIS SONS, 
02:10:59 JOSHUA AND JACOB IN THEIR PRAYERS. 
02:11:03 IT IS OUR HOPE THAT GOD WILL BLESS THE LIVES OF THE WOMEN AND MEN OF 
02:11:10 THE CHICAGO FIRE DEPARTMENT AND ALL FIRST RESPONDERS. 
02:11:18 AND WE ALSO HOPE GOD WILLING THAT WE DO NOT HAVE TO GATHER AGAIN TO 
02:11:30 ADOPT A RESOLUTION LIKE THIS. 
02:11:37 >> ALDERMAN RE BOY AS. 
02:11:42 >> I STAND IN RESOLUTION, JUAN WENT INTO THE FACE OF DANGER TO SAVE 
02:11:46 OTHERS, HE AND NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT HIMSELF.

02:11:54 ON BEHALF OF 38th WARD AND MY FAMILY, I OFFER PRAYERS. 
02:12:00 >> ALDERMAN CURTIS. 
02:12:03 >> PRESIDENT, I TOO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE RESOLUTION. 
02:12:05 I WANT TO THANK THE ENTIRE FAMILY, AND GOD AND THE ENTIRE CITY OF 
02:12:13 CHICAGO. 
02:12:15 HE WAS NOT ONLY A HERO TO YOU BUT A HERO TO HIS FELLOW FIREFIGHTERS 
02:12:20 AND TO US AND ALL THE RESIDENTS OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO, WE'LL KEEP 
02:12:25 HIM IN OUR PRAYERS. 
02:12:26 THANK YOU. 
02:12:28 >> ALDERMAN NAPALITANO. 
02:12:36 >> THANK YOU, MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBERS. 
02:12:38 I TOO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. 
02:12:42 I HAD THE HONOR TO WORK WITH JUAN AT A POLICE DEPARTMENT. 
02:12:47 I HAD THE HONOR TO WORK WITH HIM IN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AS WELL. 
02:12:51 AND AS YOU KNOW, HE'S A GREAT MAN. 
02:13:03 GREAT MAN BUT, I THINK YOU KNOW THAT TODAY YOU'RE CLAIMING A HERO FOR 
02:13:09 THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
02:13:11 MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT 
02:13:17 YOU TRAIN WITH US FIREMEN THAT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY HAS TO OFFER. 
02:13:24 AND YOU TRAINED A MAN THAT SAID I WILL GO IN. 
02:13:27 AND TO ME, I CANNOT BE MORE PROUD TO BE PART OF THAT GROUP. 
02:13:34 SO, PLEASE DON'T SEE IT AS A LOSS OF A GREAT OFFICER, A GREAT 
02:13:39 FIREMAN, BUT LOOK AT IT AS A HERO THAT THE CITY OF CHICAGO HAS GAINED 
02:13:45 AND IT'S DUE TO YOU ALL OF YOU SIGNATURE UP THERE.

02:14:17 I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY, OTHER THAN I'M SORRY. 
02:14:22 GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. 
02:14:23 THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:14:31 >> ALDERMAN NATALAFARO. 
02:14:33 >> I TOO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. 
02:14:38 JUAN BUSIO WAS A MAFN COURAGE, THAT'S WHY WE CAN SAY THAT HE'S A HERO. 
02:14:43 IT'S A GREAT LOSS TO THE CITY AND TO THE FAMILY. 
02:14:49 AND I SPEAK THIS COLLEAGUE, MY CONDOLENCES TO YOU AS WELL. 
02:14:54 YOU LOST A COLLEAGUE, A FRIEND AND A BROTHER. 
02:14:57 TO THE FAMILY AS WELL, IT'S VERY EVIDENT TO ME THAT THIS IS A FAMILY 
02:15:02 THAT IS WRAPPED IN THE CHARACTERISTICS OF COURAGE. 
02:15:06 EACH OF YOU SERVE A CITY IN ONE CAPACITY AS OR ANOTHER AS A FIREMAN 
02:15:12 OR POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND WE THANK YOU. 
02:15:16 YOUR FAMILY HAS MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES. 
02:15:18 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE. 
02:15:21 >> ALDERMAN SOLIS. 
02:15:23 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:15:29 I WOULD LIKE TO PERSONALLY RECOGNIZE. 
02:15:33 JUAN SERVED AS A MATE WITH MY DAUGHTER AND SON. 
02:15:40 THEY SWAM AT HAIRSTON PARK. 
02:15:44 BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, JUAN REPRESENTS A FAMILY THAT COMES TO THIS 
02:15:50 COUNTRY, SOME OF US COME HERE LEGALLY, SOME OF US DON'T. 
02:15:55 BUT ALL OF US CAME TO A GREAT COUNTRY. 
02:15:59 AND MAYOR, I KNOW YOU CAN SPEAK TO THIS, IF YOU KNOW WHAT THIS FAMILY 
02:16:05 HAS GONE THROUGH, HOW THEY CONTRIBUTED HOW THEY MADE THIS COUNTRY THE 
02:16:10 GREAT COUNTRY THAT THEY ARE AS MANY IMMIGRANTS, AND THEN AT THE SAME 
02:16:16 TIME, YOU SEE WHAT IS GOING ON THE BORDER OF OUR COUNTRY. 
02:16:20 AND YOU THINK WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON. 
02:16:23 WHO IS THIS GUY, THAT IS OUR LEADER AND THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE 
02:16:30 WORLD WHO HAS NO RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGITY, WHO IF YOU FOLLOW HIS 
02:16:36 HISTORY, FROM THE TIME HE WAS HE SPOKE OUT ON THE CENTRAL SIDE OVER 
02:16:41 IN NEW YORK TO WHEN HE FIRST A NOUNSD RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, AND HE 
02:16:47 MADE REMARKS ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE JUAN, AND PEOPLE LIKE ME, ABOUT BEING 
02:16:52 RAPIST AND CRIMINALS. 
02:16:55 WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT MUSLIMS, HE TALKED ABOUT OVER WEIGHT PEOPLE, 
02:17:03 FLAT CHESTED WOMEN, DISABLED PEOPLE. 
02:17:05 THIS IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY IS ABOUT. 
02:17:09 WHAT THIS MAN REPRESENTS IS THE GOODNESS OF OUR COUNTRY AND, I'M SO 
02:17:16 PROUD OF THE BUSIOS. 
02:17:17 AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.

02:17:33 TO HIS SONS, JACOB AND JOSHUA, HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND PUBLIC 
02:17:43 SERVICE FIREMAN. 
02:17:46 GARY, THOSE WERE BEAUTIFUL WORDS HONORING YOUR BROTHER. 
02:17:52 SO THE CHICAGO FIRE DEPARTMENT, MY CONDOLENCES AND TO ALL THE FIREMEN 
02:17:58 AND WOMEN. 
02:18:02 ON BEHALF OF THE 11rd WARD, I WANT TO EXPRESS MY CONDOLENCES. 
02:18:14 >> TO THE BUSIO FAMILY, YESTERDAY KNOWING THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE 
02:18:18 A RESOLUTION, I WENT TO CHECK IN ON THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT JUAN 
02:18:24 SERVED WITH, JUST TO SEE HOW THEY WERE DOING. 
02:18:31 AS THEY THEMSELVES HAVE LOST A MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY. 
02:18:36 AND WITH ALDERMAN SOLIS IS REFERRING TO, UPSTAIRS AS WE PREPARE FOR 
02:18:44 TODAY'S CITY COUNCIL, I REMINDED THE LEADERSHIP THAT THE SERVICE, 
02:18:52 YOUR PASTOR TOLD A STORY. 
02:18:57 STORY ABOUT YOUR MOTHER BROUGHT ALL THE KIDS OVER, HALFWAY THROUGH, 
02:19:07 THAT JOURNEY ON THE RIO, LIKE ANY MOTHER STARTED TO COUNT THE HEADS. 
02:19:15 SHE KNEW THERE WAS ONE MISSING. 
02:19:27 SAID WE'RE NOT GOING. 
02:19:40 AND JUAN WENT BACK AND FOUND HIS SIBLING ASLEEP UNDER A FREE. 
02:19:51 GOT ON HIS BACK AND REUNITED HIM WITH HIS FAMILY AND THEN COMMENCED 
02:20:07 THE BUSIO'S JOURNEY TO CHICAGO. 
02:20:15 THAT JOURNEY PUTS TWO FIREFIGHTERS WHO WERE FORMERLY POLICE OFFICERS, 
02:20:26 ANOTHER POLICE OFFICER WITH WHO ALDERMAN SOLIS IS REFERRING TO, WHO 
02:20:34 PRESENTLY A MOTHER WHO CARED ENOUGH ABOUT HER CHILDREN TO COME A 
02:20:40 COUNTRY THAT EMBRACED A BETTER TOMORROW, TODAY, WOULD BE SEPARATED 
02:20:45 FROM HER CHILDREN. 
02:20:48 TODAY, UNDER A NOTION OF ZERO TOLERANCE, A MOTHER WHO WOULD NOT GO A 
02:20:57 STEP FURTHER UNTIL THAT FAMILY WAS TOGETHER, WOULD BE RIPPED APART IN

04:01:08 HAVE, TESTIMONY FROM THE ACLU AT THE COMMITTEE HEARING. 
04:01:15 REGARDING ONE OF THESE PIECES OF LITIGATION. 
04:01:22 THERE IS AN ACLU, LAWSUIT THAT WAS BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF TWO CASES 
04:01:30 WHICH ACTUALLY HAVE A CONNECTION IN CHICAGO. 
04:01:35 IN ONE CASE, A WOMAN ENTERED THE UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY AT A POSTER 
04:01:42 ENTRY CLAIMING PERSECUTION. 
04:01:46 THE LAWSUIT DIS PURGED THAT HER SIX-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WAS TAKEN TO A 
04:01:51 FACILITY IN CHICAGO WHERE SHE STAYED FOR FIVE MONTHS. 
04:01:58 IN ANOTHER CASE A WOMAN FROM BRAZIL, IDENTIFIED AS MS. C, CROSSED THE 
04:02:06 BORDER LEGALLY WITH HER 14-YEAR-OLD WITH HER 14-YEAR-OLD SON WHO WAS 
04:02:10 SEPARATED AND ALSO SENT TO FACILITY IN CHICAGO. 
04:02:20 THE SON AND MOTHER WERE APART FOR NEARLY 8 MONTHS. 
04:02:27 17 STATES HAVE NOW JOINED WITH THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TO CHALLENGE 
04:02:38 THE CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT THAT IS BEING INFLICTED ON THESE 
04:02:46 FAMILIES WHO THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. 
04:02:53 ALDERMAN SOLIS AND I WILL OFFER AND IF ANYONE WISHES TO BE ADDED, THE 
04:03:05 BOSTON GLOBE IS SUPPORTING THAT ETHYL KENNEDY, 90-YEAR-OLD WIDOW OF 
04:03:19 ATTORNEY GENERAL AND SENATOR BOBBY KENNEDY IS JOINING IN A HUNGER 
04:03:24 STRIKE AGAINST IMMIGRATION POLICIES. 
04:03:27 ALDERMAN SOLIS AND I WILL OFFER ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR, A RESOLUTION 
04:03:39 COMMENDING MRS. KENNEDY ON HER UNWAIVING COMMITMENT AND URGING 
04:03:44 CHICAGOIANS TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH HUNGER STRIKE PARTICIPANT AND 
04:03:50 AFFIRM THE ROBERT F KENNEDY PLEDGE THAT THOSE WHO ENTER MORAL 
04:03:56 CONFLICT WILL FIND THEMSELVES WITH COME --COMPANIONS WITH FOEFJTZ THE 
04:04:11 FANGT OF THESE YOUNGSTERS SOME OF WHOM ARE JUST A FEW MONTHS OLD ARE 
04:04:20 HERE IN CHICAGO, SHOULD BE A WAKE UP CALL. 
04:04:26 AND IT'S THE OPINION ON MEMBERS OF FINANCE WHO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THESE 
04:04:33 MEASURES, THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING MORE TO SUPPORT THESE UNFORTUNATE 
04:04:40 CHILDREN. 
04:04:44 WE ALSO WILL INTRODUCE TODAY, A ORDER TO JOIN IN BY MANY MEMBERS OF 
04:04:52 COUNCIL TO REDIRECT A MILLION DOLLARS IN CITY FUNDS TO ENHANCE THE 
04:05:01 AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE COUNCIL TO 
04:05:09 HELP WITH THESE IMMIGRATION MATTERS, TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS THAT 
04:05:21 CRISIS HAS THESE YOUNGSTERS HERE IN CHICAGO. 
04:05:28 IT'S TRULY BECOMING A CRISIS WHICH HAS NO PRECEDENCE. 
04:05:35 SO IF ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO BE HEARD ON THIS MATTER, MEMBERS ON THIS 
04:05:47 MATTER WHICH YOU HEARD. 
04:05:48 >> ALDERMAN SOLIS. 
04:05:54 >> I'LLED WAIT FOR MY COLLEAGUE. 
04:05:58 >> ALDERMAN VIEGAS. 
04:06:01 >> THANK YOU, ALDERMAN SOLIS. 
04:06:06 I RISE TODAY HOW IMPORTANT FIGHTING BACK TRUMP ZERO TOLERANCE IS. 
04:06:11 FIRST AND FOR MOST WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN, CHILDREN ARE NOT PO 
04:06:15 LIT XAL PAUNZ. 
04:06:16 WE MAY HAVE PO LIT XAL DIFFERENCES WITH TRUMP BUT THE IDEA OF 
04:06:23 PUNISHING CHILDREN FOR THIS IS DISGUSTING. 
04:06:29 NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SAYING HE WANTS TO IGNORE THE CONSTITUTION OF 
04:06:33 UNITED STATES JUST TO PUNISH CHILDREN. 
04:06:37 THIS SO-CALLED ZERO TOLERANCE IS RACIST AND ETHICAL AND WRONG. 
04:06:41 SOY CALL TO FIGHT BACK ON THIS RACIST UNAMERICAN POLICY. 
04:06:45 THAT'S JUST THE START THOUGH. 
04:06:48 IN PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS TO SKIP OVER THE CONSTITUTION, THEY WILL 
04:06:52 FIE. USING CHILDREN FOR POLITICAL GAIN IS WRONG. 
04:06:57 PRESIDENT IS WRONG, ZERO TOLERANCE IS WRONG. 
04:07:01 CHICAGOIANS WILL STAND TOGETHER FOR WHAT IS RIGHT. 
04:07:04 MY SIGNS SAYS IT ALL, FAMILIES BELONG TOGETHER. 
04:07:08 THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT. 
04:07:09 >> ALDERMAN SOLIS. 
04:07:11 >> THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT. 
04:07:17 I THINK ALDERMAN VIEGAS AND ALDERMAN BURKE HAVE STATED T CHILDREN 
04:07:24 HAVE NOT POUNZ AND USED TO TRY TO A FORCE A POLITICAL AGENDA IN OUR 
04:07:28 COUNTRY. 
04:07:30 I MENTIONED THIS EARLIER, WHEN WE WERE RECOGNIZING FIRE FIGHTER 
04:07:36 BUSIO, IT SEEMS LIKE OUR SENSES HAVE DULLED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. 
04:07:40 EVERY TIME WE HEAR SOMETHING OUTRAGEOUS FROM OUR PRESIDENT, WHAT HE 
04:07:44 SAYS ABOUT PEOPLE, WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, AND I 
04:07:47 WANT TO POINT OUT THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT HE HAS ATTACKED ARE 
04:07:52 PEOPLE OF COLOR. 
04:07:56 YOU KNOW, BUT HE ALSO ATTACKED THE DISABLE, THE PEOPLE THAT ARE OVER 
04:07:59 WEIGHT. 
04:08:02 HE IS CONSTANTLY BE LITTLING PEOPLE THAT ARE WOMEN, THE WAY HE TALKED 
04:08:08 ABOUT THEM THE WAY BEFORE AND AFTER HE WAS PRESIDENT. 
04:08:12 I THINK IT'S A RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE HAVE TO ACT AND SPEAK. 
04:08:15 AND I THINK THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT TWO RESOLUTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO 
04:08:21 BE HEARD IN COMMITTEE AND ACTED ON IN JULY. 
04:08:24 WE NEED TO DO THIS. THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED AND THE THINGS THAT 
04:08:28 HE HAS TRIED TO BACK ON WHETHER IT'S A EXECUTIVE ORDER OR BLAMING THE 
04:08:36 DEMOCRATS OR CONGRESS, WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO REMAIN SILENT. 
04:08:44 I APPLAUD ETHYL KENNEDY FOR WHAT SHE IS DOING FOR A 24 DAY PERIOD, 
04:08:48 HOW WE'RE REMINDED OF FASTING. 
04:08:55 I'M HAPPY THAT DOLORES IS PART OF THA. BUT, WHEN WE USE CHILDREN, I 
04:09:02 HAVE FOUR GRANDCHILDREN, FROM 2 YEARS OLD TO TEN YEARS IN AUGUST, 
04:09:07 THESE KIDS LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE KIDS WE'RE SEEING EVERY DAY, OVER 
04:09:12 THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. 
04:09:16 WE CANNOT LET JUST, OTHER COUNTRIES, WHETHER IT'S THE PRIME MINISTER 
04:09:22 OF ENGLAND, OTHER COUNTRIES SPEAK OUT AND US NOT SAY SOMETHING. 
04:09:27 WE HAVE TO ACT, WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO ORGANIZE, WE HAVE TO REGISTER 
04:09:31 TO VOTE AND WE HAVE TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER. 
04:09:35 THAT'S WHAT I'M PLEADING FOR MY COLLEAGUE HERE. 
04:09:41 I HOPE YOU HAVE A UNANIMOUS VOTE, YOU HAVE HAVE COLLEAGUES TO BE ABLE 
04:09:48 TO AFFIRM THAT WE SUPPORT OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND SPEAK OUT AGAINST 
04:09:50 THIS PRESIDENT. 
04:09:51 THANK YOU. 
04:09:55 >> ALDERMAN CARDENAS. 
04:09:58 >> THIS RESOLUTION, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, I HEARD A SPEAKER HERE IN 
04:10:04 THE 30-MINUTE PERIOD, TALK ABOUT FOLLOWING THE RULES AND WHY THAT'S 
04:10:06 POSH. 
04:10:09 THAT LEAD TO ME BELIEVE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE BEING TAKEN BY TRUMP 
04:10:16 LANGUAGE AND THAT HE IS JUSTIFIED BY IT. 
04:10:19 IF YOU FOLLOW THE LAW, IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT LAW. 
04:10:24 ASYLUM SEEKER AT THE POIFNT ENTRY, HAVE A LEGAL SITE TO HAVE A CASE 
04:10:29 HEARD BEFORE A JUDGE. 
04:10:32 AND THEIR LEGAL RIGHT, AND HERE ARE CASE OF ASYLUM, THAT CHILD IS 
04:10:37 WITH THAT PARENT OR THAT PERSON, ALSO HAS RIGHTS. 
04:10:41 AND THEY'RE BEING USED AS PAWNS CORRECTLY. 
04:10:45 THIS POLICY NOT JUST IN HUMANE, IT'S LUDICROUS. 
04:10:49 IT TAKES YOU BACK TO THE NATS'. 
04:10:55 SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY, THEY DIDN'T FOLLOW THE RULES. 
04:10:58 THEY DID FOLT RULES. 
04:11:03 IT CALLS TO STATE THEIR CASE AND THEN YOUR CASE WILL BE ADJUDICATED. 
04:11:09 BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE KID WITH NEM IS TAKEN AWAY. 
04:11:13 AND THE REASON THEY ARE TAKEN AWAY, THEY WANT TO PERSON TO FEAR TO 
04:11:19 FATHER POIFNT ENTRY AND SEEK ASYLUM. 
04:11:22 THEY BELIEVE THAT IF THEY DO THAT, IT WILL DETER FROM PEOPLE OF 
04:11:28 COMING FOR ASYLUM. 
04:11:29 THE COUNTRY THAT LIVES YOU THE STATUTE OF LIBERTY OF NEW YORK. 
04:11:35 IT GET UP SET WHEN PEOPLE SAY, THEY DIDN'T FOLLOW THE RULES, THEY 
04:11:41 FOLLOWED THE RULES, BUT USING CHILDREN AS PAWN IS NOT JUST DEPLORING, 
04:12:01 IT'S ILLEGAL. 
04:12:03 THEY HAVE RIGHTS JUST AS YOU AND I HAVE. 
04:12:05 AND THOSE CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN FROM THEIR ARMS TO MAKE A CASE. 
04:12:11 SHIPPED 2000 MILES AWAY HERE IN THE CITY. 
04:12:13 WE HAVE ABOUT 66 CHILDREN HERE, HOUSED BY AN ORGANIZATION. 
04:12:18 MANY CITIES ATLANTA, ACROSS THIS COUNTRY THAT IS HAPPENING. 
04:12:23 THERE IS NO REASON FOR THAT. 
04:12:24 THANK YOU. 
04:12:28 >> ALDERMAN ROSA. 
04:12:30 >> THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT. 
04:12:32 I WANT US TO IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE OCCURED IF MARY HAD JESUS RIPPED 
04:12:42 FROM HER ARMS AS SHE CROSSED BORDERS THROUGH DANGEROUS LANDS. 
04:12:46 I THINK THAT THIS WEEK, THIS MONTH HAS LEAD ME TO REFLECT ON THE FACT 
04:12:51 THAT IT'S ONLY WHEN IT IS DARKEST THAT WE START. 
04:12:57 THAT IN SUCH A DPARK MOMENT IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY WHERE OUR 
04:13:02 GOVERNMENT IS QUOTING ERRONEOUSLY THE BIBLE TO JUSTIFY THE SEPARATION 
04:13:09 OF FAMILIES AND CELEBRATING CHILDREN CUTTING THEM IN CAGES, THAT 
04:13:13 WE'RE ABLE TO SEE THAT THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. 
04:13:16 THAT WE'RE ABLE TO SEE PEOPLE FROM ALL RACES AND BACK GROUNDS, COME 
04:13:19 TOGETHER AND SAY NOT IN OUR NAME AND NOT IN OUR COUNTRY. 
04:13:23 WE WILL RESIST. 
04:13:25 WE WILL PROTEST, WE WILL DEMAND THAT JUSTICE BE THROUGHOUT THE LAND. 
04:13:29 I WANT TO THANK MY XLAOEGZ. 
04:13:32 I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN BURKE FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE THAT 
04:13:37 REAFFIRMS THE VALUES. 
04:13:39 BUT I WANT TO SAY THAT WE AS A CITY MUST GO BEYOND REDDICK. 
04:13:45 MUST GO BEYOND UTTERING BEAUTIFUL WORDS AND PUTTING BEAUTIFUL WORDS 
04:13:48 ON PAIRP. 
04:13:49 BUT I WANT TO FURTHER THANK MY COLLEAGUES BY SIGNING ON. 
04:13:59 THAT IS SOMETHING SUBSEQUENT, THAT IS SOMETHING MEANINGFUL THAT WILL 
04:14:05 DO IN POLICY, WHAT TRUMP IS DOING WITH THIS. 
04:14:10 WE WILL PROTECT FAMILIES WHILE HE'S SEEK TO GO SEPARATE FAMILIES. 
04:14:16 BUT ON THAT POINT OF MEETING TRUMP'S POLICIES OF OUR OWN, I WANT US 
04:14:22 TO REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE POLICIES THAT AT THIS MOMENT CONTINUE TO 
04:14:32 COLAB RATE AND COLUDE WITH ICE. 
04:14:36 WE HAVE SOME LOOP HOPES THAT ALLOWED FLAWED INSTRUMENTS LIKE THE 
04:14:41 DATABASE TO BE USED TO PUT CHILDREN IN CAGES WITH ICE. 
04:14:45 LOOPHOLES THAT ALLOW INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE ANY CRIMINAL CHARGE 
04:14:50 DESPITE NOT BEEN PROVEN GUILTY TO BE PUT IN CAGES BY ICE. 
04:14:54 SO AS WE SAY NO TO THE RED RICK TO THE POLICIES OF DONALD TRUMP, LET 
04:15:00 US DO SO WITH MEANINGFUL THINGS BIT MEASURE OF CHAIRMAN BURKE, BUT 
04:15:06 ALSO BY REVISITING OUR SANCTUARY CITIES AND REMOVING THOSE PEOPLE. 
04:15:12 AND LASTLY, LET'S NOT FORGET, THAT IT'S NOT JUST IMMIGRANT CHILDREN 
04:15:16 IN CAGES AT THE BORDER IN COOK COUNTY, WE HAVE BLACK CHILDREN IN 
04:15:26 CAGES, IN COOK COUNTY WE HAVE BLACK CHILDREN IN BLACK CAGES. 
04:15:32 LET US ENSURE THAT WE HAVE JUSTICE FOR ALL. 
04:15:33 THANK YOU. 
04:15:37 >> ALDERMAN PAWAR? 
04:15:46 >> I WANT TO THANK ALDERMAN SPONSORS. 
04:15:51 PEOPLE AROUND THIS COUNTRY ARE ACTING ON THEIR WORSE AND INSTINCTS, 
04:15:57 THEY'RE BEHAVIOR. 
04:16:08 SO WHEN WE HAVE ASYLUM AND REFUGEES. 
04:16:11 REMEMBER THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FLYING TERROR AND PERSECUTION 
04:16:16 AND MURDER AND HORRIBLE GOVERNMENTS MANY OF WHOM ARE EMPOWERED 
04:16:23 BECAUSE OF RESULT OF COLONIALISM, POLICIES THAT THIS COUNTRY WOULD 
04:16:33 MANIFEST TESTING AND COLONIAL POWERS IN EUROPE, WHEN THEY'RE FLEEING 
04:16:38 GOVERNMENTS SO THEY CAN COME HERE AND RISK THEIR LIVES AND SEEK ASYLUM 
04:16:45 WHICH THEY'RE LEGALLY ALLOWED TO DO. 
04:16:48 WE'RE NOT TURNING OUR BACK TO THEM, DISGUSTING. 
04:16:52 SO, I HAVE A TOUGH TIME COMING HERE AND DEMANDING THAT WE ALL STAND 
04:17:01 AND PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG, WHEN WE HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL MAN 
04:17:09 IN THE COUNTRY, WHO IS USING THE POWER OF HIS OFFICE TO PIT BULL 
04:17:21 PEOPLE AGAINST PEOPLE AND ONE ANOTHER. 
04:17:28 SO, I I SHOULD NOT TAKE TOO MUCH MORE. 
04:17:35 IT'S JUST, THERE COMES A POINT WHERE IT'S TOUGH TO SAY, WHAT ARE WE 
04:17:39 DOING HERE. 
04:17:46 AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL WHAT DO WE SAY ANYMORE. 
04:17:50 AT MY HOUSE, WE HAVE OUR CASH READY AND PASSPORTS READY. 
04:18:00 IF THERE IS A TIME, AND MANY THROUGH MY WIFE'S FAMILY, MANY WHO ARE 
04:18:08 HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS. 
04:18:10 WE LIVE A VERY DARK TIME A VERY DISGUSTING TIME, IN MANY DAYS, I'M 
04:18:16 ASHAMED TO BE AN AMERICAN. 
04:18:36 STOP DEMONIZING PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE SEEKING ASYLUM FOR THEIR 
04:18:38 FAMILY. 
04:18:39 THANK YOU. 
04:18:41 >> ALDERMAN SANTIAGO. 
04:18:45 >> THANK YOU, MA DPAM CHAIR. 
04:18:50 I WANT TO COMMEND CHAIRMAN BURKE OF TAKING THIS INITIATIVE OF HAVING 
04:18:54 THIS RESOLUTION. 
04:18:57 I'M PROUD TO BE COSPONSOR AND I WANT TO THANK REST OF MY COLLEAGUES 
04:19:01 WHO ALSO JOINED IN THIS EFFORT. 
04:19:04 IT'S IRONIC, AT THIS TIME AS LATE AS 2018, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
04:19:10 IS CONTINUING TO PURSUE POLICIES DESIGNED TO EXCLUDE TO BAN PEOPLE 
04:19:16 WHO ARE DIFFERENT, AND DIVIDE AND CONQUER TO LITERALLY KEEP FAMILIES 
04:19:24 APART, FAMILIES WHO ARE ESCAPING VIOLENCE. 
04:19:28 WHO DOES NOT KNOW THAT SEPARATING FAMILIES FROM THEIR FAMILIES IS 
04:19:34 TRAUMATIC. 
04:19:35 THIS IS TRAIJ, THAT IS LOUSY PUBLIC POLICY. 
04:19:43 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS DEFENDING THESE TERRIBLE ACTIONS 
04:19:49 QUOTED ROMANS 13 AND HE INSUE YATED THAT WE HAVE TO--. 
04:20:14 I HAVE SEENLE PICTURES TYING THIS TO THE HOLOCAUST. 
04:20:18 I THINK WE'RE LOSING THE TITLE OF BEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. 
04:20:26 CARDINAL BLAZE QUIPAGE ALSO SAID AND REMINDS US, SESSIONS LEFT OUT 
04:20:31 SOMETHING IMPORTANT, THE REST OF THE STORY. 
04:20:36 THE NEXT PART OF ROMANS 13, WE ARE TOLD LOVE THY NEIGHBOR, LOVE DOES 
04:20:44 NOT HARM TO A NEIGHBOR AND LOVE IS THE FULFILLMENT OF THE LAW. 
04:20:50 WHAT PASTER CELEBRATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS IS LOVING, NONE! 
04:20:56 THIS IS WHY I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION PUT FORWARD TO THE 
04:21:03 BY CHAIRMAN BURKE TO DENOUNCE THESE PRACTICES AND TO CALL ON THE 
04:21:09 CORPORATION COUNCIL TO DRAFT AN AMICUS DRAFT SO THAT THEY HEAR OUR 
04:21:14 VOICES HERE IN CHICAGO LOUED AND CLEAR. 
04:21:17 WE ARE A SANCTUARY CITY, WE ARE A CITY OF IMMIGRANTS AND CHILDREN OF 
04:21:21 IMMIGRANTS. 
04:21:23 THAT'S WHY WE'RE SO DIVERSE HERE, BECAUSE WE REPRESENT, BLACK, BROWN, 
04:21:30 WHITE, LATINOS, WE REPRESENT WHAT A CITY IS ALL ABOUT. 
04:21:33 WE WILL NOT STAND QUIETLY, WHILE WE ARE TEARING OUR FAMILIES APART. 
04:21:40 CHICAGO HAS TO STAND UP, AND DO WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR 
04:21:45 VOICES ARE GOING TO BE VERDICT ALL THE WAY IN WASHINGTON DC. 
04:21:49 AND LET THE PRESIDENT OF THIS, GREAT NATION THAT HE'S ABSOLUTELY 
04:21:53 WRONG AND HE IS SETTING SUCH A BAD EXAMPLE. 
04:21:58 BECAUSE WHEN KIDS, WATCH TV AND THEY SEE OF THIS, THOSE KIDS ARE 
04:22:09 PROBABLY INDOCTORATE IN PROJECTING ALL KIDS THAT ARE NOT BLACK OR 
04:22:12 AMERICAN, THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE MOVING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. 
04:22:14 AND WE HAVE TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE SURE THAT AT LEAST THE 
04:22:19 CITY OF CHICAGO HAS A VERY RESPONSIBLE POSITION TO PUT A STOP TO 
04:22:24 THIS, THANK YOU. 
04:22:25 >> CHAIRMAN BURKE.

05:03:46 AND IN PARTICULAR TO MY COMMITTEE. 
05:03:49 YOU KNOW, 8 YEARS AGO OR A LITTLE OVER YEARS AGO, WHEN I WAS FIRST 
05:03:55 APPROACHED BY MAYOR DALEY, BECOME THE CHAIR OF THE COMMIT EYE.

05:04:03 LIGHTS, WELL THAT WAS ME. 
05:04:08 AND THAT YEAR, THAT CONCERN SOON WASHED AWAY WHEN I HAD MY FIRST 
05:04:12 MEETING WITH PATTY. 
05:04:13 AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A SEVENS COMFORT TO KNOW THAT SHE HAS BNT 
05:04:20 DIRECTOR OF ZONING AND SOMEBODY THAT I WOULD MEET WITH HER, PRIOR TO

05:08:49 GOD BLESS YOU. 
05:08:55 >> ALDERMAN RILEY. 
05:08:58 >> THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT, I TOO SPANNED IN SUPPORT OF THIS 
05:09:02 RESOLUTION. 
05:09:03 I THINK THERE IS ONE PERSON THAT APPRECIATES PATTY MORE THAN YOU, AND 
05:09:10 THAT'S PROBABLY ME. 
05:09:13 YOU'VE BEEN AN INCREDIBLE SOURCE FOR ME AND MY STAFF. 
05:09:20 YOU HELPED AND OVER THE YEARS, I'VE HEARD AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT. 
05:09:35 COMMISSIONER PATRICK, IS GOING TO BE EXCELLENT ZONING ADMINISTRATOR 
05:09:42 BUT PATTY YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY IRREPLACEABLE. 
05:09:46 I WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I DID ENOUGH THAT. 
05:09:50 BUT FROM THE HEART, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING YOU TAUGHT ME 
05:09:54 AND MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF THESE PROJECTS WERE DONE PROPERLY. 
05:09:59 UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING, IF WE RUN INTO AN OBSTACLE, THE 
05:10:06 ANSWER WAS NOT YOU CANNOT DO T.YOU WOULD FIND A CREATIVE WAY TO GET 
05:10:11 IT DONE. 
05:10:12 THAT'S RARE IN GOVERNMENT. 
05:10:14 AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SITS WITH ME WHEN I THINK OF YOU. 
05:10:19 AND SO YOU'RE VERY SPECIAL INDIVIDUAL THAT WILL BE MISSED. 
05:10:24 AND LIKE CHAIRMAN SOLIS AND I WILL MISS THE MOST. 
05:10:27 THANK YOU FOR YOUR ALL YOUR SERVICE AND I MISS YOU WELL. 
05:10:31 I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE NEXT WEEK WHEN I CANNOT 
05:10:34 CALL YOU. 
05:10:36 >> CHAIRMAN BURKE. 
05:10:38 >> THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT. 
05:10:41 FIRST OF ALL, I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT PATTY--AS THEY SAY IN 
05:10:51 THE LAW, RESIDENT OF LOCAL (INAUDIBLE). 
05:10:55 BUT IT IS AN INTERESTING HOW SHE HAS BECOME AN INSTITUTE IN THIS 
05:11:03 BUILDING AT SUCH AN EARLY AGE. 
05:11:04 [APPLAUSE] 
05:11:12 TO SAY THAT SHE'S ABOUT TWO PERSON IN THE BUILDING IS NOT AN 
05:11:19 EXAGGERATION, BUT IN ADDITION, I'VE USED THIS PHRASE, BECAUSE IT'S 
05:11:25 RARELY GET TO DO IT. 
05:11:26 IN THIS BUILDING. 
05:11:30 THE PHRASE IS THAT IT'S NICE TO DO WORK BUT IT'S MORE IMPORTANT. 
05:11:36 PATTY IS NICE. 
05:11:39 AND IN SO MANY WAYS, NOT SIMPLY TO SOMEBODY THAT MIGHT HAVE, A TITLE 
05:11:48 OR SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME INFLUENCE BUT SHE REALLY TOOK THE 
05:11:54 TIME TO TRY TO HELP AN AVERAGE PERSON THAT WAS CONFRONTED WITH THIS 
05:12:05 DILEMMA OF BUREAUCRACY. 
05:12:08 SHE REALLY BELIEVED IN DOING GOOD FOR OTHER PEOPLE. 
05:12:12 BUT KNOW WHAT THAT COMES FROM THE TRADITION THAT SHE GREW UP IN IN 
05:12:25 THE 34 WARD AND ALL THE OTHERS THAT WE'VE WORKED WITH: THAT REALLY 
05:12:30 MADE A DIFFERENCE. 
05:12:34 I HOPE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE A STRANGER TO THIS BUILDING. 
05:12:39 SHE HAS SUCH A WEALTH OF INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE THAT I TRUST. 
05:12:52 A LOST POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY. 
05:12:56 AND WHOEVER DOES PRESENT THE OPPORTUNITY TO HER, WILL GET A TERRIFIC 
05:13:06 SMART DEDICATED KIND PERSON. 
05:13:08 PATTY GOOD LUCK. 
05:13:11 GOOD HEALTH AND YOU, I THINK REFLECT THE BEST OF WHAT WE WOULD LIKE 
05:13:19 TO THINK THE CITY OFFICIALS REPRESENT. 
05:13:22 CONGRATULATIONS. 
05:13:26 >> ALDERMAN AUSTIN. 
05:13:30 >> THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT. 
05:13:33 I GUESS I HAVE REMARKS OF ALDERMAN SOLIS, WHEN YOU COME HERE AND YOU 
05:13:40 HAVE A PROJECT THAT YOU THINK THAT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE 
05:13:44 DOING, AND THEN WHEN YOU GIT TO ZONING, YOU FIND OUT HOW MUCH YOU 
05:13:47 DON'T KNOW. 
05:13:49 BUT WHEN SOMEBODY IS THERE FOR YOU THAT CAN WALK YOU THROUGH AND 
05:13:54 TEACH YOU I USED TO COME. 
05:14:01 AND CHAIRMAN, THE FIRST THING THAT HE WOULD SAY, IS ASK PATTY. 
05:14:07 OKAY, WHO IS PATTY? 
05:14:09 BUT TO COME TO KNOW HER AS ALDERMAN BURKE SAID, SHE'S AN ICON IN THIS 
05:14:14 BUILDING. 
05:14:15 BECAUSE OF ALL THE PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE DONE, ALL THE ONES THAT WE 
05:14:17 HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD. 
05:14:19 WANTED DO, TRIED TO DO, COULDN'T DO. 
05:14:29 PATTY HAS BEEN THERE FOR ALL OF US. 
05:14:38 ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, BECAUSE AS YOUR REPLACEMENT THAT DOES NOT TAKE 
05:14:40 AWAY FROM HIM. 
05:14:42 BRU PATTY FOR THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE SHOWED TO ALL OF US HERE, 
05:14:47 NOT JUST US BUT OTHER GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN HERE AS WELL, THAT THESE 
05:14:51 ALDERMAN HAVE TAKEN OVER ONCE THEY'VE BECOME ALDERMAN AND THEN TO 
05:14:56 USHER IN HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL. 
05:14:59 YOU ARE THE BEST! 
05:15:04 SO I, MAKE A MOTION THAT WE DON'T ACCEPT THE RESIGNATION. 
05:15:11 BUT WE WILL ALL TRULY MISS YOU. 
05:15:14 AND DON'T CHANGE YOUR CELL NUMBER BECAUSE WE WILL STILL NEED YOU. 
05:15:18 THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT. 
05:15:20 >> ALDERMAN DAVID MOORE. 
05:15:23 >> THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. 
05:15:33 FIRST OF ALL, CHAIRMAN BURKE, HE SAID THE TRUTH AND FROM HIS HEART 
05:15:39 AND I ECHO EVERYTHING THAT HE SAID. 
05:15:41 BUT WHEN I THINK OF PATTY, THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY SAY, THEY SAY THE 
05:15:49 FULL NAME, YOU HEAR MOHAMMED ALLY, MICHAEL JORDAN THEY NEVER SAY ONE 
05:15:55 NAME AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF GREATNESS, AND THEY WERE GREAT IN THEIR 
05:15:59 DIFFERENT AREAS AND PATTY IS DEFINITELY GREAT IN THIS AREA. 
05:16:04 AND BESIDES WHAT ALDERMAN BURKE SAID, THAT IS SO TRUE. 
05:16:09 INSTITUTION IN HER OWN RIGHT. 
05:16:10 THAT'S MAJOR. 
05:16:12 BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING, I TOLD HER THERE IS NOTHING LIKE LEAVING WHEN 
05:16:18 PEOPLE STILL WANT YOU TO STAY, AND NOT PUCKER YOU OUT THE DOOR AND 
05:16:23 EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, WHEN YOU CAN WALK OUT AND YOU KEEP YOUR GOOD 
05:16:27 NAME, YOUR CHARACTER AND YOUR INTEGRITY. 
05:16:31 AND PATTY, YOU HAVE DONE THAT TO THE UTMOST. 
05:16:35 AND I APPRECIATE YOU AND JUST GETTING STARTED AND WORKING WITH YOU, 
05:16:39 I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO MISS YOU, BECAUSE YOU CAN ALWAYS GO TO 
05:16:43 SOMEBODY THAT IS GOING FOB FAIR. 
05:16:45 AND THAT'S ALL YOU WANT, EVEN IF THEY SAY NO, AS LONG AS THEY'RE 
05:16:50 BEING FAIR, THAT'S ALL YOU WANT. 
05:16:52 AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. 
05:16:54 AND NOT JUST TO US THE ALDERMAN BUT THIS CITY. 
05:16:57 EVERYBODY IN THE CITY DON'T KNOW YOU, BUT YOU WERE VERY IMPORTANT TO 
05:17:03 WHAT WE DO HERE IN THIS CITY.
