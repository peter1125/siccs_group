00:03:21 God ultimately it's about the city of Chicago and the citizens and we 
00:03:22 ask that you bless us and you abide us if you keep us ever mindful to 
00:03:23 give the honor and the glory and the praise in Jesus name we pray Amen 
00:03:24 >> Public comment, Madam Clerk 
00:03:25 >> We will begin the public comment period limited to a maximum of 30 
00:03:55 minutes each speaker limited to three minutes the time remaining for 
00:03:56 each speaker is shown on the clock on the wall. Any written comment 
00:03:57 will be 
00:03:58 available for [Indiscernible] the first speaker is [Indiscernible] 
00:03:59 >> Halloween morning I was here talking about the two policemen being 
00:04:16 charged with a cover up. I told you should be more concerned about 
00:04:17 what happens in these halls. Weeks later Reverand Burks office is 
00:04:21 Raided, kind of funny talk about corruption in here. Now Alderman 
00:04:22 Solis 
00:04:26 heroic he can wear a wire but he cant show up here part of his 
00:04:27 actions. if you 
00:04:32 Know anything about police work that means they had something on Solis 
00:04:33 and that's why he turned to wire you guys are dirty as most of you 
00:04:39 guys are doing the exact same thing Burke has done for decades you 
00:04:43 just haven't gotten caught you haven't been arrogant enough to do it 
00:04:46 on the telephone or whatever the case may be I can't wait for more 
00:04:47 snitches to come out I really can't 
00:04:48 >> Nice, go get some more numbers on coppers alderman, you are a class 
00:05:00 act. [indiscernible] You are real class act, pathetic. Mayor, you only 
00:05:01 got about 
00:05:06 Eight weeks left in office thank God. You've been pretty much a 
00:05:07 disgrace for a 
00:05:16 Mayor [Indiscernible] you strip away the healthcare of people that 
00:05:17 work their whole life for it and you do it gleefully with a smile on 
00:05:28 your face you're such a smug arrogant little man I swear to God I 
00:05:29 can't wait for you to be gone. Maybe in your remaining time you could 
00:05:32 Negotiate a police contract and all the pandering fools who want to 
00:05:40 take your spot maybe you should worry more about the pension crisis 
00:05:41 before this city turns into Detroit because there won't be a city to 
00:05:42 govern if you don't wake up and get your act in gear. This pension 
00:05:45 crisis will crush the city but none of you seem concerned about that 
00:05:48 you just worry about the next election laughing and giggling over 
00:05:53 there you are as big a disgrace as the Mayor swear to God Heaven 
00:05:57 help this city. 
00:06:05 >> The next speaker is Austin [Indiscernible] 
00:06:06 >> My name is Austin [Indiscernible] I live at 800 in Lakeview. I'm 
00:06:07 here 
00:06:32 to speak about an issue that deeply concerns me and my neighbors. 
00:06:33 It's an issue that defines the upcoming election one that will 
00:06:34 determine whether we will overcome the challenges we face. One that 
00:06:35 is held the city back for generations. Corruption. Last Friday I 
00:06:39 submitted an ordinance [Indiscernible] that would mandate a two-term 
00:06:45 limit for city Council members. It reads as follows any person 
00:06:46 elected to the city Council of the city of Chicago shall serve no 
00:06:58 more than two four-year terms in office. Is a simple sentence that 
00:06:59 would send a powerful message that our elected representatives are 
00:07:00 truly ready to take on the culture of corruption that City Hall is 
00:07:01 truly ready 
00:07:08 For reform and our aldermen will change the system to allow fresh 
00:07:09 faces into 
00:07:14 These chambers to make that that reform a reality. 
00:07:17 [Indiscernible] Chicago is by most measures the most 
00:07:22 corrupt city in America and has been for generations. Earlier this 
00:07:23 month Ed Burke joined a long line of Alderman charged with 
00:07:25 various forms of public corruption a shameful legacy that has defined 
00:07:30 our politics long before he was elected. Unfortunately [Indiscernible] 
00:07:48 the corruption can't be solved on an individual basis prevent 
00:07:56 corruption [Indiscernible] to solve that you have to undertake 
00:07:57 painful and systematic reform for my [Indiscernible] there are many 
00:08:04 who would prefer to deny the crisis exists rather than deal with 
00:08:07 [Indiscernible] estimates corruption cost the city of Chicago around 
00:08:18 $500 million per year. [Indiscernible] that number but no one denies 
00:08:26 the problem. And it's well past time for leadership in our city to 
00:08:31 take on corruption and finally root it out. I'm asking you today 
00:08:35 [Indiscernible] the crisis of corruption in our city to and insider 
00:08:47 deals pay to play arrangement and system set up held us back for 
00:08:51 generations. Corruption is a crisis in Chicago we need to start 
00:08:56 treating it like a crisis. We can solve every problem we face but 
00:08:57 only if you have [Indiscernible] 
00:09:15 >> [audio technical issues, please stand by] 
00:09:16 >>Testing 
00:13:20 >> Testing 
00:13:21 >> Testing 
00:13:22 >> The next speaker will be Pat Thomaseo 
00:13:23 >> Audio problems before I'm supposed to get up, coincidence? Good 
00:14:15 morning fellow citizens of Chicago alder people. It's good to be 
00:14:29 here, my name is Pat [Indiscernible] and you know me as man of the 
00:14:30 people Saturday night at 10 PM with an encore presentation at 11 PM. 
00:14:34 The old people know. By the way, pass the resolution, am I right? I 
00:14:39 see you old people. Elders. I got to tell you never in 1 million 
00:14:46 years did I think I would get the chance to speak in this beautiful 
00:14:53 hall. Mainly because I figured there was a vetting process before you 
00:14:58 let anyone get up and ramble on for three minutes about anything 
00:15:01 they want but I just walked in off the street and here I am. Let's 
00:15:06 address the elephant in the room. Something I know this chamber is a 
00:15:15 buzz over this morning, something you're all talking about, let me 
00:15:16 make a statement here and now. I am not running for Mayor. I figured 
00:15:28 it's easier for me to say that rather than add to the list of people 
00:15:29 who are it's easier to keep track of. You are saying, Pat, you have a 
00:15:30 pulse 
00:15:38 Vague name recognition, you know a couple of guys in the union you 
00:15:39 should run but I'm not going to do it because I have too much going 
00:15:42 on. Not enough in my boat. I want to see 20 people at the next debate 
00:15:43 each 
00:15:56 getting 12 seconds each to debate issues like crime and education and 
00:15:57 why we keep losing conventions to Rosemont but I won't be the guy. 
00:15:59 I've spent the last couple of days talking to the people on the 
00:16:03 streets getting their concerns about things they would like me need to 
00:16:07 address to you I asked them for questions for the alder people. The 
00:16:14 first one, [Indiscernible] billboard not enough on the expressway as 
00:16:24 far as I'm concerned. This time last year, you'd see 10 of them on a 
00:16:25 drive to O'Hare. Last week I saw seven and we can do better than that. 
00:16:31 These traffic management people, do they have to be so angry all the 
00:16:32 time? Why are they yelling at me? Telling me to go. I see the light 
00:16:33 and it says 
00:16:37 Green and I get it. What else? Can we get [Indiscernible] to stop 
00:16:38 messing 
00:16:47 around with this nonsense like flamethrowers and psychedelics and do 
00:16:57 something plausible like build a pod underground that goes 150 miles 
00:16:58 per hour and can take you from O'Hare to downtown in 12 minutes. 
00:17:03 Something like that. Finally I want to thank you for the chance to be 
00:17:05 here, thank you to the Mayor for allowing me the chance to speak even 
00:17:08 though my statute still remains in storage I appreciate the forum 
00:17:12 >> Thank you the next speaker is Melvin Bailey 
00:17:13 >> Thank you. I'm no stranger to speaking at the Council. We always, 
00:17:31 we see each other and acknowledge each other and I'm still waiting on 
00:17:37 [Indiscernible] but I'd like to thank Aldermen Mitts for 
00:17:49 allowing us to sit up at the table with her with the construction and 
00:17:50 police and fire Academy much needed in our ward to create jobs and 
00:17:51 I'd like to all the Aldermans, the west side and south side aldermans. 
00:18:01 What's important because we feel it's very important for us to create 
00:18:02 economic development in our community especially in the 37th Ward I'd 
00:18:03 like to thank Alderman Mitts for allowing us to sit at the table 
00:18:06 and select contractors laborers and subcontractors. That can be a 
00:18:09 model for the rest of you guys to make sure the community is striving 
00:18:14 and working. I want to share something, I talked to a couple of 
00:18:22 Aldermans, and the housing plan Mr. Mayor, the value housing plan 
00:18:28 is $1.4 billion approval. What I want to make sure I came up with a 
00:18:32 petition and amendment to the value housing plan to ensure 
00:18:35 African-Americans play a viable role and to rebuild their own 
00:18:39 neighborhood so I want to make sure I have 18 aldermen and I want 
00:18:44 them all unfortunately I don't have the other aldermen signature but 
00:18:51 I have all 18 African-American Aldermans and I want you all to look 
00:18:58 at it and identify project summary specifically where the money is 
00:19:02 going. New construction rehab emergency board up emergency heating. 
00:19:04 We need to look at that and I want to talk to you guys. Last but not 
00:19:13 least the city buying plan I'm here talking about the city buying 
00:19:20 plan. Your administration Mayor Shannon Andrews I hate to call out 
00:19:25 her name but I had no phone call from her. [Indiscernible] had no 
00:19:26 phone call and the only thing we try to do is see how we can get 
00:19:31 [Indiscernible] to pay a part of the process of getting the small 
00:19:36 contracts in this book. Mr. Mayor if you can help us if you can help 
00:19:43 us and city Council members, please help us reach out to Jamie Reed, 
00:19:47 Shannon Andrews to make sure to ensure we can take some of these 
00:19:54 contracts out of these books and create jobs. A simple contract. Car 
00:19:56 washing, $5 million. Window washing contracts for CTA at half $1 
00:20:03 million. Simple contracts we don't have to have skills to do. People, 
00:20:12 please aldermen, I look at you guys to support us in this initiative 
00:20:13 so we can create jobs and Mr. Mayor when are we going to meet? Mr. 
00:20:23 Mayor, you see me and acknowledge me, I know we have a conversation 
00:20:24 before and I will meet you in the back. 
00:20:25 >> Thank you Mr. Bailey, the next speaker is Mark Holler 
00:20:34 >> Good morning, good morning, good morning. I'm getting ready to go 
00:20:35 to 
00:20:42 Washington DC and meet with the greatest president of the United 
00:20:44 States ever had so we can talk about -- the greatest president, crazy 
00:20:55 like me. Who dislikes unions and all these things hurting poor people 
00:21:00 in the city. In this conversation we will talk about the enforcement 
00:21:05 of laws that will open up opportunities for our community. In and 
00:21:10 around the city. You talk about violence unemployment all of these 
00:21:13 things but you never do anything about it. Chicago Housing Authority 
00:21:18 we had to file a suit to put people to work. Now that the Mayor is 
00:21:25 leaving maybe I will become the Mayor and get things done. Maybe we 
00:21:32 pick a new city Council so we can get things done. Save a few of you 
00:21:33 All, very few of you. Where you have these housing plans you have 
00:21:41 these development plans look to include us. Because if you don't, you 
00:21:46 force us to go up against guys like [Indiscernible] bad old Italian 
00:21:54 mob boy, bad old guys that told us they're going to run things the 
00:22:01 Teamsters and the rest of the unions. We are going to fight with them 
00:22:04 the summer and fight with the unions this summer. And having this 
00:22:05 great 
00:22:12 president of the United States of America we are asking him to help 
00:22:13 us with these unions lets do some 
00:22:17 Union busting in the city can we get help from someone in the room 
00:22:23 anybody show of hands? Do some union busting. Unions hate us and we 
00:22:34 hate unions so we will partner with the greatest president to do what 
00:22:35 we can to dismantle these crazy union people to make sure. You all 
00:22:38 assigned zoning permits because you give opportunities to everybody 
00:22:40 but us so you force us to rise up. Maybe we will get a Mayor that 
00:22:46 believes in what we believe in. With that, I will take my seat thank 
00:22:47 you very 
00:22:54 much 
00:22:55 >> Thank you. The next speaker is George Blakemore 
00:22:56 >> Mr. George Blakemore, the city is known to be great Doctor 
00:23:14 King says Chicago is the most racist city in the United States. 
00:23:19 Institutional racism. Mayor, that racism cannot exist without the 
00:23:23 help of other black people. Other black people. 
00:23:33 >> We have 18 down here, [Indiscernible] we've got [Indiscernible] 
00:23:45 are not on the East Coast, there right here. You keep putting them 
00:23:51 right back in. Right back in. When we were in [Indiscernible] when 
00:24:06 the white man came, he didn't know the layout of the area. He had 
00:24:12 other Blacks to help him. What we have to do as black people, God 
00:24:19 gave us everything we need, all we have to do is use what you gave us. 
00:24:28 [Indiscernible] looked just like you. We've got black hating black 
00:24:37 and you guys go back and put them in it is a culture of corruption. 
00:24:49 [Indiscernible] black people, you need sanctuary. You need your 
00:24:58 [Indiscernible], you need your [Indiscernible]. Why are you so sour 
00:25:08 when Trump says he wants to build the wall and keep them out, we are 
00:25:11 already in. [Indiscernible] [Indiscernible] was always looking for a 
00:25:25 home. So black people are you getting some type of enjoyment from 
00:25:46 that. You've given them your vote and your vote is valuable. 
00:25:58 [Indiscernible] you get nothing. No economic development in your 
00:26:02 neighborhood and then you come begging, [Indiscernible] 
00:26:13 >> Thank you, Mr. Blakemore 
00:26:14 >> The next speaker is David Peterson 
00:26:21 >> Testing, do I have permission to speak? How is everybody doing 
00:26:29 today, my name is David Peterson and I'm president and Executive 
00:26:30 Director of [Indiscernible] Museum, we are the first black labor 
00:26:32 History Museum that honors black labor history and we are 24 years 
00:26:40 old located in the ninth Ward. I am a global ambassador of 
00:26:46 cultural economic development and that is an alternative to economic 
00:27:00 development in our community. It's where we use heritage and culture 
00:27:01 as a means of social and economic development, 24 year proof of 
00:27:02 concept of that. We are not funded by city state or federal funds. 
00:27:12 I'm here because we have come up with cultural manifesto which will 
00:27:13 show people in urban communities how to implement the process through 
00:27:14 a means of a cultural complex. We are seeking to acquire abandoned 
00:27:22 firehouses, 15 words. We'd like to use the ninth Ward as the 
00:27:26 launching pad. We will be able to interact with people in the tourism 
00:27:33 industry around the globe. Last year, 58 million people came to 
00:27:39 Chicago, that is 19 million more than 2011 and created 20,000 jobs so 
00:27:44 we are excited to take advantage of the sleeping giant in our 
00:27:49 backyard called tourism. I have taken the liberty to make proposals 
00:27:53 [Indiscernible] in the 20th, 23rd, six, 47, 25, 24, 27, 36, 24, 5 
00:28:06 and 15. The desire is to use quality opportunity zones to complete 
00:28:11 the project meaning investors will not have to pay capital gains or 
00:28:16 taxes for 10 years. We are encouraged because this is a tourism 
00:28:17 neighborhood and we will be able to do this. In our neighborhood, we 
00:28:23 are the first and only national Monument, three years old and going 
00:28:30 on four. We are already showing and proving that tourism is working, 
00:28:33 we are bringing people to the museum from around the world. The 
00:28:39 national [Indiscernible] Museum, the first and only black labor 
00:28:46 History Museum in the world which represents the first and only black 
00:28:47 labor union, the brotherhood of [Indiscernible] and in addition, 
00:28:50 because we are in the south lakefront region which is McCormick Place 
00:28:58 to Laporte County Indiana connecting Lake Michigan to [Indiscernible] 
00:29:06 , we know the developers and we want to be ahead of what is going on 
00:29:07 so we can safeguard our neighborhoods from gentrification by letting 
00:29:09 people know proof of concept that gentrification doesn't necessarily 
00:29:17 have to be synonymous. Good morning and thank you for allowing me the 
00:29:33 opportunity to speak today. My name is Doctor Caitlin O'Grady and I 
00:29:38 have a PhD in social work. I'm speaking as a matter of the 
00:29:43 collaborative for community [Indiscernible] a coalition of local 
00:29:58 organizations providers and community residents focused on 
00:29:59 facilitating mental health service access in underserved. I'd like to 
00:30:00 urge the Council to pass a resolution that calls for the creation of 
00:30:01 a public mental health clinic service expansion. We know in the 
00:30:14 [Indiscernible] there are dire challenges to accessing mental health 
00:30:15 services. In May 2018, the collaborative for community wellness 
00:30:16 release findings from the mental health needs assessment conducted 
00:30:18 across 10 areas for economic hardship on the Southwest side. Survey 
00:30:22 data from 28 hundred respondents indicated despite an overwhelming 
00:30:30 demand for mental health services, factors including cost, lack of 
00:30:33 insurance coverage and a lack of services in close proximity to 
00:30:37 barrier service access, cost was the top-ranked barrier with 57 
00:30:43 percent of all respondents saying cost is an impediment. Findings 
00:30:46 from a similar assessment conducted in South Lawndale across a 
00:30:53 three-year span similarly indicated that cost transportation and 
00:31:05 being unsure where to access services was the top three barriers 
00:31:06 among survey respondents. While the Chicago Department of Public 
00:31:07 Health has identified a list of 250 providers that offer mental 
00:31:09 health services, there are clear [Indiscernible] of accessibility 
00:31:16 [Indiscernible] after contacting all of these agencies, we found that 
00:31:23 eight percent of the providers were duplicate listings, 15 percent 
00:31:24 lacked a working phone number and an additional 18 percent could not 
00:31:31 be reached after placing a minimum of two phone calls. Tell us the 
00:31:35 mental health service delivery service cannot be easily navigated 
00:31:52 furthermore only 15 percent of the survey providers offered services 
00:31:53 free of charge indicating that providers throughout the city are not 
00:31:54 truly accessible to low income uninsured and underinsured residents. 
00:31:59 It is also important to note that not only is there an over reliance 
00:32:00 on qualified health centers in the list of providers but only 18 
00:32:05 percent of the [Indiscernible] we surveyed offer services free of 
00:32:20 charge. Considering the gaps we have identified to date, there is an 
00:32:21 urgent need for the proposed resolution. We must invest in a public 
00:32:22 mental health structure infrastructure that offers free long-term 
00:32:24 mental health services for all community residents throughout Chicago. 
00:32:33 [Applause] thank you Miss O'Grady. Maria Franco accompanied by 
00:32:40 translator [Indiscernible] 
00:32:41 >> Hello my name is Maria [Indiscernible] and I'm a mother and 
00:33:08 promoter health promoter from Bryant Park neighborhood Council 
00:33:09 >> During this time I've had the opportunity to work with Bryant Park 
00:33:28 neighborhood Council as a health promoter 
00:33:29 >> The surveys we were able to collect 300 surveys which we created a 
00:33:51 report that notifies the findings of the lack of mental health 
00:33:57 services 
00:33:58 >> Unfortunately the lack of services had brought great violence in 
00:34:12 the community 
00:34:13 >> We ask our public officials to support the mental health issue 
00:34:14 >> Back in 2012 with the closure of seven clinics, the 707 clinics 
00:34:56 have cost a great violence in our community and we are here today to

00:34:58 mental health movement 
00:34:59 >> Organizations have come together to let you know that the lack of

00:35:34 these mental health services are provided 
00:35:35 >> Please vote yes to the reopening of the clinics and extension for 
00:35:50 the number [Indiscernible]

00:35:52 >> Testing. Hello city Council members, my name is Carmen 
00:36:18 [Indiscernible] and I live in Elizabeth Senior Apartments, in Lincoln 
00:36:22 Park. I am a member of the Jane Addams Senior caucus. As a resident, 
00:36:35 I have seen and experienced the daily health and safety terrorist 
00:36:36 that comes with living in subsidized senior housing. Breathing in 
00:36:41 dust containing mold spores, smoke management retaliates against 
00:36:49 residents that stand up for themselves and advocate for safe living 
00:36:53 conditions. These abysmal living conditions are made worse during 
00:37:00 periods of renovation. [Indiscernible] have been subjected to units 
00:37:07 without featuring the winter daily water shut off and grab bar 
00:37:08 removals just to name a few. All of this occurs because safety of 
00:37:16 residents has been consistently treated as a last priority. Today, 
00:37:21 the seniors declare not so fast, not so easy in dignities and the 
00:37:30 worries of old age, stuffed away in a deteriorating senior unit as we 
00:37:33 bravely fight the battle of time. Just feeling like we are doing time. 
00:37:42 City Council, we gather here today to ask for your support for this 
00:37:50 Chicago relocation plan ordinance, passing the relocation plan 
00:37:54 ordinance is the first step in demonstrating to seniors across the 
00:37:59 city that lives matter and their representatives are putting their 
00:38:02 constituents health and safety before developer dollars. Seniors make 
00:38:10 change, seniors matter and we need to be your priority thank you 
00:38:11 >> Thank you. The next speaker is Jackie page 
00:38:12 >> Good morning City Council. And citizens of Chicago. I'm coming 
00:38:33 here this morning to speak about our black Council. I believe the 
00:38:43 black Council has not served its community well. You do not vote the 
00:38:52 conscience of your communities. You vote the conscience of the Mayor. 
00:38:55 And because you don't vote the conscience of the community, many of 
00:38:59 you will not have your seats. I believe some of you representatives 
00:39:06 should not have your seats. You are afraid of your own shadow, you do 
00:39:15 not pay attention and you shame us when you sell yourselves out for 
00:39:21 power. And for money you take under the table. You should turn to 
00:39:27 your citizens and you should vote our conscience and not yours. Many 
00:39:34 of you aldermen have not listened to us so some of you deserve to be 
00:39:40 fired. I say that some of you like David Moore whom I tried to meet 
00:39:50 with and was told he was too busy need to be fired. I think some of 
00:39:59 you need a vacation, a permanent vacation. I remember when Alderman 
00:40:06 Moore voted no for the library and then he turned around and voted 
00:40:11 yes, why would you vote yes? The community said it wanted a community 
00:40:18 benefits agreement, the community never got a benefits agreement but 
00:40:27 you all voted yes. You all voted yes because you are on the table. I 
00:40:33 believe some of you deserve to be fired and I hope many of you are. 
00:40:39 >> Thank you Ms. page. The next speaker is Victoria [Indiscernible] 
00:40:40 >> Good morning Your Honor and City Council. My name is Victoria and 
00:40:58 on the condo president of the NYPR on Lakeshore Drive. I'm here 
00:41:04 today to ask you to postpone your vote on section 17-0400 of the 
00:41:15 Chicago zoning ordinance. This set of amendments was proposed only 
00:41:22 December 12 and it only went to the zoning committee last week on 
00:41:30 Thursday, January 17. These amendments propose transportation 
00:41:36 oriented developments along a variety of bus routes many of which 
00:41:40 unfamiliar with. Hours are in an area that is extremely dense and the 
00:41:46 amendments could make our area more dense and that's a problem. 
00:41:50 However, in my grant work with the Chicago public schools, I've seen 
00:41:54 many that these transportation oriented developments along bus routes 
00:41:59 could be beneficial. I urge you to postpone your vote on this today 
00:42:02 to give your constituents a chance to talk with you. Five weeks is 
00:42:07 not a long time to consider this and the amendments are broad. Thank 
00:42:10 you for your time 
00:42:14 >> Thank you. All speakers for public comment period have been heard. 
00:42:21 Thank you everyone the time allotted has expired. Madam Clerk 
00:42:22 >> A resolution from his honor the Mayor and aldermen Burnett and 
00:42:49 Santiago [Indiscernible] as of early January of this year principal 
00:42:50 Rebecca Parker of training Center high school working with the 
00:42:51 homeless was a victim of domestic violence and therefore afraid to 
00:42:52 return to where she was living and whereas her efforts to support the 
00:42:55 student were exhausted [Indiscernible] sought help from the police 
00:43:00 department to ensure student safety and to find a new place to live. 
00:43:04 Field training officer [Indiscernible] M police officers 
00:43:13 [Indiscernible] responded to the school to provide assistance. Having 
00:43:23 already been advised the student had special needs, the officers took 
00:43:27 time to call me is sure heard they were here to help. Earning her 
00:43:29 trust is not an early test because the abuser threatened her that she 
00:43:38 would be taken to jail if she called the police. Over several hours 
00:43:39 the officers attempted to find shelter and rather than accept any 
00:43:46 available shelter to complete the assignment, the officers use their 
00:43:47 experience and knowledge to evaluate each option and reject those 
00:43:59 that did not provide the student support she needed. They concluded 
00:44:00 no shelter option would be suitable, they had no choice to take the 
00:44:01 student to a nearby hospital. The student became upset when they 
00:44:02 removed her from the school but the officers were able to calm her 
00:44:04 and provide her with a notebook. Where officer drew up on his 
00:44:24 training and experience in working with special needs students to 
00:44:25 explain what was happening in the way the student could understand 
00:44:26 and the officer worked directly with the principal Parker to share 
00:44:27 resources to support the student and the family after the officers 
00:44:28 left. The Southwest actions of officers [Indiscernible] to provide 
00:44:37 dedication to duty and commitment, the community values inherent in 
00:44:38 those all serve in the police department. Be it resolved that the 
00:44:42 Mayor and city Council of the city of Chicago hereby express our 
00:44:49 admiration and gratitude to the Chicago police officers 
00:44:53 [Indiscernible] for their support and compassion in response to the 
00:45:07 student needs for assistance. A suitable copy of this resolution will 
00:45:08 be presented to the officers and placed on permanent record in the 
00:45:09 personnel files as a token of our gratitude and esteem 
00:45:10 >> The Chair recognizes Alderman O'Connor 
00:45:11 >> Are deferred to the chairman of the committee on public safety 
00:45:12 >> Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen and City Council, this 
00:45:28 morning, I'm pleased to join with the members of City Council to 
00:45:29 express our gratitude and appreciation to officers [Indiscernible] of 
00:45:40 the first District. The actions they took to protect the frightened 
00:45:45 girlq2 from [Indiscernible] school who had endured the trauma of 
00:45:49 domestic violence in her home is not the kind of story typically 
00:45:55 reported in the media. There was no shooting, the report on 
00:46:02 high-speed vehicular pursuit for emergency fire rescue, nothing as 
00:46:10 dramatic as that. We have instead a simple act of compassion and 
00:46:14 kindness on the part of three officers who took the time to listen to 
00:46:17 the concerns of this young girl, stricken by the [Indiscernible] to a 
00:46:24 troubled household and the imminent threat of violence. This is what 
00:46:29 you don't read on the front pages of the newspaper. The girl told them 
00:46:41 of a horrific story, repeated acts of cruelty inflicted upon the 
00:46:42 mother with death threats occurring in the Riverdale household. He 
00:46:49 gave the officers [Indiscernible] a child of such a young age should 
00:46:53 have to experience such abuse is unimaginable. Regrettably, we all 
00:46:58 know too well that it happens far too often in many of our 
00:47:04 communities. Officer [Indiscernible] spoke with the victim in a way 
00:47:10 she could easily understand expressing sympathy understanding and a 
00:47:15 personal promise that she would not be placed in harm's way. After 
00:47:26 spending a lot of time investigating a suitable number of shelters 
00:47:27 and finding them inadequate for her needs, the officers took her to 
00:47:28 the hospital and remain by her side until it was time to go leaving 
00:47:32 her with a pen to draw with. The officers displayed their dedication 
00:47:45 and duty with nobility and dignity without the glare of TV cameras 
00:47:48 and media coverage. In law enforcement, that's how it goes sometimes. 
00:47:51 On behalf of the city Council, I want you to know how proud we are of 
00:48:00 all of you. Congratulations and God bless the men and women of the 
00:48:03 Chicago Police Department. Alderman Dowell 
00:48:04 >> I rise to be associated with this resolution. I'd like to thank 
00:48:16 the officers for their compassionate response to a deeply traumatized 
00:48:22 young lady. I know how sensitive these situations are especially when 
00:48:29 the police show up. I want to thank Julia [Indiscernible] who resides 
00:48:50 in the third Ward for providing information to access resources to 
00:48:51 help this young lady and principal Parker. I also want to acknowledge 
00:49:01 principal Parker of Graham school who administers Graham with great 
00:49:02 sensitivity and care. These acts of kindness certainly must be 
00:49:07 acknowledged by the city of Chicago and the city Council and we are 
00:49:11 glad to honor you this morning. Thank you very much for your service 
00:49:14 >> Alderman Burnett 
00:49:15 >> Thank you Mr. President, I'd also like to rise in support of this 
00:49:23 resolution to commend all who have been involved with the situation, 
00:49:32 thank you very much for having compassion and consideration for a 
00:49:33 young lady who was homeless but also had a special need. One of the 
00:49:42 things that folks don't recognize about police officers and people 
00:49:43 who work for the public, they are human beings and you have a heart 
00:49:53 and you care for people also. We want to thank you very much for 
00:49:54 being a human being and caring for that young lady 
00:49:57 >> Alderman Moore 
00:49:58 >> I rise in support of this resolution. This helps me as I continue 
00:50:09 to heal in our communities for everything going on. [Indiscernible] I 
00:50:16 post on Facebook but that we do not as my colleague said see in the 
00:50:20 papers. We are in support of our officers because our officers do a 
00:50:27 great job and I appreciate you all and I tell people every day time 
00:50:34 after time, who do they call if they are in trouble? If that lady 
00:50:38 needs your help, you went over and above. For that, I commend you and 
00:50:46 think you and I appreciate the work that you do and sometimes you 
00:50:53 have voices out here that are making sure you are protected and have 
00:51:01 every service and resource you need to do your jobs well. Thank you 
00:51:02 so much into your family for allowing you to be there to help serve 
00:51:10 because they give up a lot as well and I want to say thank you I 
00:51:11 appreciate it 
00:51:12 >> Alderman Curtis 
00:51:19 >> Thank you. I support this resolution [Indiscernible] this is the 
00:51:25 perfect example of [Indiscernible] the compassion you show all of our 
00:51:33 officers in the city of Chicago thank you for all you do 
00:51:36 >> Alderman Santiago 
00:51:41 >> Thank you. I also want to rise to congratulate this officers who 
00:51:48 had the courage and the quick response to save this child. We should 
00:51:54 feel proud of all of you for your action in saving that student, I 
00:51:58 believe she was a special ed student. Officer [Indiscernible] I 
00:52:03 believe you live in my ward so thank you so much I'm very proud of 
00:52:08 you. This is a very outstanding testament that could prove that 
00:52:13 officers are doing a lot more than just driving around or arresting 
00:52:21 people. This is about you committing to someone who was in a 
00:52:27 difficult situation. I commend you for your job and for your quick 
00:52:32 response when someone like this student was in desperate need so 
00:52:39 congratulations, we are very proud of you and keep up the good work, 
00:52:40 thank you 
00:52:42 >> Alderman [Indiscernible] 
00:52:47 >> I rise for this resolution. [Indiscernible] very much deserving of 
00:52:57 the praise heaped on you today. I believe as young police officers 
00:52:59 you make a very proud you make the city very proud [Indiscernible] 
00:53:05 with pride that you have. This is the beginning of your career so as 
00:53:10 we talked about police training, it's given at the Academy but it 
00:53:17 also gives on the streets for what you do. I want to give a special 
00:53:22 thank you to the field training officer 
00:53:23 >> For teaching you and training you and the way we have that you are 
00:53:30 able to recognize our residents and citizens in need and act 
00:53:32 appropriately when they do so so thank you very much for your service 
00:53:38 to the city and helping to make sure a life is receiving the 
00:53:44 resources that is so needed. Thank you so much 
00:53:46 >> Alderman Moreno 
00:53:47 >> Thank you. I rise in support of the resolution. I think it's 
00:53:58 commonly accepted that the serve and protect is associated with the 
00:53:59 police and I want to thank you for being ready and accessible 
00:54:03 definition of what that looks like it's wonderful to see that not 
00:54:11 only your personal experiences but the training the department is 
00:54:12 offering is put into play and we are working to redefine and 
00:54:18 reestablish the community from the most vulnerable to everybody 
00:54:25 above. Thank you for being there with the student and for the 
00:54:31 community and for the work you do every day. Thank you Mr. President 
00:54:32 >> Alderman [Indiscernible] 
00:54:33 >> Thank you Mr. President. I support this resolution. Awesome job, 
00:54:47 you never know what your day will entail and every day is an 
00:54:50 adventure and we appreciate what you did and you could do it in the 
00:54:56 future God bless you and the police department thank you 
00:54:57 >> Know whether Alderman wish to be recognized, on behalf of the 
00:55:06 entire city, principal, teachers and the three officers, this is an 
00:55:14 example, you did not do this to be recognized but I think it's 
00:55:15 appropriate when people not only do their job but do their 
00:55:18 citizenship that they should be recognized. The young student was in 
00:55:28 need and all of you created what I believe is a circle of love and 
00:55:29 what we call [Indiscernible] and you stood by a child through a 
00:55:33 difficult moment in a process and I think it deserves recognition we 
00:55:43 ask of everybody and it was not a job, not because it was in the 
00:55:44 code, it was because it was in your heart that you served in the 
00:55:52 principal created a culture at the school that gave a child the sense 
00:55:53 of confidence to speak up about something that was horrific. That 
00:56:00 would not be possible that was not a culture as a principal and 
00:56:01 teacher that that student felt comfortable in the level of trust 
00:56:06 because of all of you and our city built a level of compassion thank 
00:56:08 you 
00:56:09 >> [Applause]

01:22:53 to thank all of my colleagues for their support on this resolution 
01:23:00 and it's important. This is about more than reopening facilities. 
01:23:18 It's about analyzing the entire city mental health services fullest 
01:23:19 ugly and addressing gaps found in 2019. It's about reevaluating the 
01:23:20 budget of mental health services and identifying costs where 
01:23:21 beneficial adjustments can be made. Using new data, some of which has 
01:23:22 not existed until several years ago. To find new and innovative ways 
01:23:28 to deliver care to Chicago residents. All options are on the table, 
01:23:40 they are not limited to reopening facilities and while that is a 
01:23:41 possibility we will also explore other facilities offering modern 
01:23:43 methods of service and engaging wraparound services. We also welcome 
01:23:54 a new Governor in office who I prioritizes mental health services and 
01:23:55 working to increase accessibility. We look forward to working with 
01:23:57 Doctor [Indiscernible] and the administration to move forward. We are 
01:24:03 not looking back, we are looking forward. I appreciate again all of

01:24:20 >> So ordered 
01:24:21 >> Alderman Joe Moore on housing 
01:24:22 >> Members of the City Council and the committee on housing and real 
01:24:44 estate held a hearing on Wednesday, January 16, 2019 pursuant to the 
01:24:45 meeting I have a series of items to report recommending passage of 
01:24:47 the following ordinances. One sale of city-owned land through the 
01:25:01 adjacent neighbors land acquisition program and the third Ward 
01:25:02 payment sale of various city-owned properties in the third and fourth 
01:25:03 Ward. The sale of various properties large lot sale program in the 
01:25:04 fourth Ward. Six, ninth, 10th, 1517 1820 21st 24th 28 and 34th wards. 
01:25:14 Additionally the committee recommended passage of the Chicago 
01:25:21 relocation plan introduced at the October 31 City Council meeting. I 
01:25:26 believe the aldermen would like to speak about that 
01:25:27 >> Alderman Osterman 
01:25:35 >> I want to thank Chairman Joe Moore for the report and the support 
01:25:56 of the committee. The senior relocation ordinance basically tries to 
01:25:57 provide respected seniors as they do important renovation projects on 
01:25:58 senior buildings and I want to thank those that cosponsor this and 
01:25:59 specifically the Jane Addams Senior Caucus for the leadership on 
01:26:00 behalf of seniors throughout Chicago to ensure when these projects 
01:26:01 happen, seniors are treated fairly and with respect. Thank you 
01:26:06 >> [Applause] 
01:26:07 >> Alderman Burnett 
01:26:08 >> President, also as a cosponsor and unfortunately I was not able to 
01:26:23 be at the housing committee meeting because I was at a ribbon cutting 
01:26:24 for the library in my ward, I want to say I'm happy to be a cosponsor 
01:26:33 of this ordinance. I just had several hours to weeks in a row of 
01:26:38 being at a senior building of seniors being moved because the owner 
01:26:43 had to rehab the apartment and to feel how the seniors are concerned 
01:26:51 and how stressful it was for them and with them being moved, this 
01:27:00 ordinance is definitely needed because we've had some blind seniors 
01:27:01 who did not know what was going on and sometimes seniors take time to 
01:27:12 understand and time for them to recognize what is being done to them 
01:27:13 and they need the patients with this ordinance. This ordinance gives 
01:27:22 patience and consideration to seniors as they are about to be moved 
01:27:23 with everything they own for all their lives being moved out of their 
01:27:26 homes. I'm happy to be a cosponsor of the ordinance thank you 
01:27:29 >> Alderman Moore 
01:27:30 >>I too am happy to be a cosponsor of the ordinance and Chair of the 
01:27:42 committee the ordinance. Was brought before I congratulate aldermen 
01:27:48 instrument and the advocates for investing this matter. We had a 
01:27:50 senior building in my ward that receives some very welcome and needed 
01:27:58 renovation. The relocation however could have been handled better and 
01:28:03 it's nice to have some guidelines and expectations for those, not 
01:28:09 only those who live in those buildings but also the developers who 
01:28:19 now have guidelines and know when to give seniors notice and how to 
01:28:24 treat them. It's a much-needed ordinance and I appreciate everyone 
01:28:29 who worked on it. If there is no objection, I move for passage by the 
01:28:30 last most favorable roll call vote of the committee on finance and 
01:28:38 associated unsuccessful motion 
01:28:39 >> So ordered

01:39:27 get appear and talk about folks who are leaving, I feel old. He's 
01:39:31 been here for 33 years, [Indiscernible] the clerk's office years ago 
01:39:38 before I was in aldermen. Chris has always been helpful, always had 
01:39:51 the same demeanor ever since I've known him. Chris would never give 
01:39:54 flustered about anything. That I knew of. Always had a smile on his 
01:40:02 face, always very kind and nice, he took care of business all the 
01:40:10 time. We are so grateful, my staff wants to thank you for everything 
01:40:11 you have done for us in my office thanks you very much. Whenever we 
01:40:19 need something, we call you and it is done. You will be missed, 
01:40:23 Chris. Now you get to keep your shoes off all the time. God bless you 
01:40:30 and enjoy your retirement 
01:40:32 >> Alderman Austin 
01:40:39 >> Thank you. I've been here for 24 of your 33 years but coming in 
01:40:44 the door, we start off as a [Indiscernible] and the first thing you 
01:40:49 want to know is who do I see about the payroll? Everybody kept saying 
01:40:54 go see Chris. I think I came to the clerk's office five times not 
01:40:59 knowing I pass to those five times. Who is Chris? When I finally got 
01:41:03 an opportunity to meet you, I'm grateful. I'm grateful Chris because 
01:41:08 anytime there was a problem, in a time there was an issue with 
01:41:14 anything, we knew who to call. You will be definitely missed. I will 
01:41:24 miss you dearly. Because I don't have anyone to fuss with now about 
01:41:27 is this the right amount on this or that check? Are they taking the 
01:41:33 right amount out? I'm so grateful God allowed you [Indiscernible] and 
01:41:39 being in this building 24 years with all the ups and downs, to both 
01:41:51 of our mayors, you have been steadfast and the one individual we 
01:41:52 could say we could call on at any time. God bless you Chris. We will 
01:41:57 truly truly miss you. And I will have sometimes on her hands now that 
01:42:03 you are leaving. Enjoy your retirement, and know that God allowed you 
01:42:06 to be here 33 years to work for us, enjoy the time you are now 
01:42:14 allowed to say I don't have to go to work. Bless you 
01:42:15 >> Alderman Moore 
01:42:24 >> Thank you. I stand in support of this resolution. Chris, it has 
01:42:36 been almost 4 years, was going to be the [Indiscernible] is that you 
01:42:42 were very helpful. Just helpful and you did it as with a demeanor, a 
01:42:51 couple of times, it sort of saying our constituents sometimes not 
01:42:56 recognizing you are dealing with the aldermen plus more. At that 
01:43:01 time, your situation was important and every time, my situation was 
01:43:19 very important to you like it was the only one you had to deal with 
01:43:20 and recognizing these other colleagues, you've made all of them feel 
01:43:21 the same way in for that, that takes a special person to make 
01:43:24 everybody feel like what you are doing is a priority and like you are 
01:43:34 the only one coming to me and you will be greatly missed but I have 
01:43:35 no doubt you've educated people because that's the type of person you 
01:43:37 are. You are always going to teach learn and show it even when you 
01:43:47 are short on what we are explaining and not understanding what we are 
01:43:48 presenting, you come back and say this is what you need to do. I want 
01:43:49 to thank you and your family for allowing us because you are a 
01:44:01 servant and sometimes [Indiscernible] and we want to say thank you 
01:44:12 for your hard work and I wish you all the best and 27 countries, I'm 
01:44:13 trying to get to 27 neighborhoods so continue to have fun and enjoy 
01:44:14 your retirement God bless you 
01:44:15 >> Alderman Napolitano 
01:44:16 >> [Speaker off mic] 
01:44:17 >> Sitting in that Chair when you retire, you can tell who is being 
01:44:38 impacted in the city and from me to you, you have mastered your trade 
01:44:42 here MAC response times, the way you work with everyone's office, 
01:44:45 going into retirement, you take that with you, you helped out a lot 
01:44:54 of people and did a great job and great service for Chicago. I cannot 
01:44:55 thank you enough for how well you worked, especially as a freshman 
01:45:04 aldermen, you dropped everything you had every time to help us and 
01:45:05 now when you retire sit back and know you left it on the court and on 
01:45:10 the ice if you leave it on the floor when you leave and God bless you 
01:45:12 enjoy your retirement 
01:45:13 >> Aldermen [Indiscernible] 
01:45:24 >> I agree. [Indiscernible] Chris, I have known you for 25 years at 
01:45:30 least. Your smile you have right now is the same smile you always 
01:45:35 have, don't change. Don't change. We don't see that too often or 
01:45:50 often enough I should say. I really appreciated knowing you, my staff 
01:45:51 has appreciated the assistance you provided for us. Is going to leave 
01:45:54 a void but please enjoy yourself as my colleagues have said. There is 
01:45:58 a lot of time to be had, 33 years, you are good. Enjoy yourself and 
01:46:04 your family. Thank you for everything you have done 
01:46:09 >> Chris, I want to make an acknowledgment of one of our guests here 
01:46:15 today. Charles Watkins is the Chief of Staff for the lieutenant 
01:46:21 Governor and I want to make sure we welcome you, thank you 
01:46:23 >> [Applause] 
01:46:24 >> Alderman Santiago 
01:46:35 >> Thank you. Chris, where are you going? You kept it very quiet. 
01:46:42 This took us by surprise and I'm about to cry because you have been 
01:46:52 such a great person, 3 1/2 years I have been here, you have been an 
01:46:58 amazing guy, and I know sometimes I walk into your office unannounced 
01:47:00 and you are having a bite to eat and you put it down so you can take 
01:47:04 care of me and I appreciate it. This resolution does not say enough 
01:47:11 about you. I thought you were in your 30s because you look so young 
01:47:13 so take that as a compliment. I wish you the very best, I'm going to 
01:47:21 miss you because you have been a great person every time I need some 
01:47:24 help, even if it is not under your jurisdiction, you always direct me 
01:47:30 in the right way so I wish you the best. 27 countries you have 
01:47:35 visited and I hope starting the next day after your retirement, you 
01:47:39 start a new journey to travel all over the world. Congratulations for 
01:47:45 your great job and I want to commend you and will be forever grateful 
01:47:48 and I'm sure your wife and family are happy. Thank you so much and 
01:47:51 good luck 
01:47:53 >> Alderman Harris and 
01:47:58 >> Thank you. I rise in support of this. Chris, it has been two 
01:48:05 decades out of your 33 and I remember coming in and we had paper 
01:48:14 checks and had to go by your office and I always had an opportunity 
01:48:15 to chat with you and that's how we formed our bond over the years. 
01:48:23 You've always been efficient, always been responsive and we are truly 
01:48:24 grateful for the way you have guided us and assisted us over the 
01:48:26 years. You will definitely be missed but I wish you must fun in your 
01:48:31 retirement congratulations 
01:48:34 >> Alderman Harris 
01:48:39 >> I rise in support of the resolution. Chris, I can't believe you 
01:48:45 are leaving. I wish you Godspeed. You are kind, humble, 
01:48:51 understanding, patient and I think you because you've been doing this 
01:48:58 for so long, I don't know who will be able to step into your shoes 
01:49:01 and take the job and we will be calling a new person Chris anyway. We 
01:49:06 won't be able to [Indiscernible] but I really appreciate the public 
01:49:11 service and working with us. 50+, and not just us but our staff, 
01:49:21 that's a lot Chris and you remain very consistent and I've got to say, 
01:49:28 it's not fair that I have gained this weight and you still look the 
01:49:29 same, there's no fairness in the world. Thank you, Chris. Love you 
01:49:36 much and appreciate your hard work and commitment to us and I wish 
01:49:40 you well and send me a postcard on your next excursion 
01:49:41 >> Alderman Beale 
01:49:45 >> Thank you. I rise to support this resolution with hesitation 
01:49:53 because you will be greatly missed. Even though everybody has said 
01:49:58 everything that needs to be said about what you have done for the 
01:50:04 city, your shoes cannot be filled. The void you are leaving in the 
01:50:11 city [Indiscernible] you've been there for us from day one every 
01:50:13 aldermen when we first got here [Indiscernible] so who is going to be 
01:50:19 that person now? We have no idea, Madam Clerk. Hopefully, you are 
01:50:25 training that person before you leave to basically emulate what you 
01:50:29 have done in the city. The service you have paid is second to none 
01:50:36 and for that, we are extremely grateful and to show how much 
01:50:43 [Indiscernible] outside of this Council, my staff has sent text 
01:50:49 messages telling me you have to get up and say something about Chris 
01:50:50 because they are watching on the Internet and I'm hoping they get 
01:50:53 back to work after this resolution is done but that goes to show the 
01:51:04 effect you have had on the entire staff so we you will be greatly 
01:51:05 missed and we appreciate you and job well done, you have served the 
01:51:08 city well 
01:51:09 >> Alderman Scott 
01:51:10 >> Thank you. I rise in support of the resolution. Chris, I don't 
01:51:18 think I talked to anyone in the clerk's office more than you including 
01:51:24 my wife. That is saying something. I am so appreciative of the help 
01:51:31 you have given me, my staff, similar to that of Alderman Beale when I 
01:51:40 let my staff know you were retiring, they said I have to get up and 
01:51:49 say some words. [Indiscernible] speak highly of you anytime they call 
01:51:50 or I call you are Johnny on the spot. I am so appreciative being a 
01:52:03 new aldermen coming in and having someone you can ask questions and 
01:52:04 they give you answers and responses immediately is very important so 
01:52:05 thank you for all you've done, Godspeed and you do look too young to 
01:52:11 retire, send us some postcards. 
01:52:16 >> Alderman Cardenas 
01:52:18 >> Chris, please don't go. You are one of the most humble nicest 
01:52:29 genuine people that I've met inside this building. I could go on for 
01:52:37 days to find words to say how nice and wonderful you are and how well 
01:52:41 you do your job and you do it like that. You are a gem and when you 
01:52:50 make that track down by me, you have my number and you better call me. 
01:52:54 Congratulations, enjoy the rest of your life, sir. 
01:53:02 >> Alderman Maldonado 
01:53:07 >> Thank you. Chris, that little office [Speaker off mic] you touch 
01:53:20 250 lives [Indiscernible] not only with the aldermen but the staff. 
01:53:27 Such a genuine care for each and every one of us and I cannot say 
01:53:34 enough how much of a good person, good human being you are. I know 
01:53:44 you are. [Indiscernible] good luck to you and I wish you well and 
01:53:50 enjoy the rest of your retirement 
01:53:51 >> Alderman Hopkins 
01:54:02 >> Thank you. I rise for a procedural inquiry. Can we vote this 
01:54:09 resolution down and prevent them from retiring? If that were the 
01:54:13 case, I urge a no vote., Chris, you are quite literally your 
01:54:22 replaceable your institutional knowledge and the cumulative effect of 
01:54:30 the experiences you've had working in this building and serving the 
01:54:31 people of Chicago and the clerk's office and the six different clerks 
01:54:34 you've worked for, everything you have done and learned and given to 
01:54:37 us as elected officials in support of our jobs. We can never repay 
01:54:45 you enough and we can never acknowledge sufficiently how much you 
01:54:46 have meant to this body and the city of Chicago. You are a model 
01:54:53 public servant and everything that people should aspire to be when 
01:55:00 they set out to serve their community and their government and public 
01:55:01 life whether an elected office or an employment position on staff. We 
01:55:15 are all in it together in here for the same purpose and you reach the 
01:55:16 finish line with an unblemished record, accolades, acknowledgment, 
01:55:17 friendship and you are someone that cannot be replaced. Whoever is 
01:55:21 going to take your position will have to take some time to come up to 
01:55:30 speed because you set the bar high and the expectations we have for 
01:55:31 the service you provide and will be challenging for the person. I 
01:55:42 wish you nothing but success and continued travels throughout the 
01:55:43 world, enjoy your retirement, you have earned it 
01:55:44 >> Alderman Cardenas 
01:55:47 >> I join [Indiscernible] as well. Chris, you have been a friend 
01:55:56 really [Indiscernible] I like to call you the EF Hutton of payroll 
01:56:04 because [Indiscernible] I have three screens in front of you but we 
01:56:08 will miss you. [Indiscernible] so thank you for your service and many 
01:56:19 travels 
01:56:20 >> Alderman Smith 
01:56:26 >> Chris, when you are a freshman aldermen, there's not a whole lot 
01:56:34 of training and there's always been a comfort from the minute I 
01:56:38 became an alderman that if I really needed to try to understand 
01:56:40 something about my staff or how to run the office, you were always a 
01:56:46 comfort to many of us to help us get going and do what was right in 
01:56:51 the most basic of ways. It's a pleasure to work with you and you are 
01:57:00 such a fine public servant. Thank you 
01:57:02 >> Alderman Burke 
01:57:03 >> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, please stand and say a word 
01:57:13 on behalf of Chris, as he marks the end of the city career. 
01:57:22 [Indiscernible] [Speaker off mic] mom is at home, he's a faithful son. 
01:57:40 The Jesuits taught him well. The idea of family faith and friends 
01:57:47 have permeated Chris's career at City Hall over these 33 years. If my 
01:57:57 calculation is correct, he has gone through eight [Indiscernible] now 
01:58:00 so literally, the first member of the city Council [Indiscernible] he 
01:58:11 is an important part of our annual program to teach new aldermen what 
01:58:20 they should know. Truly, he has been the go to guy in the clerks 
01:58:24 office for over three decades. Almost 27 countries he has visited, I 
01:58:31 wonder if you find any place to go but I'm sure he's creative enough 
01:58:38 to find ways to spend his retirement years. I know all the members of 
01:58:45 city Council join with the Mayor and clerk, and hope that Chris will 
01:58:50 have many years of good health and peace with his family and reflect 
01:59:02 on and enjoy he has a job well done, congratulations 
01:59:10 >> Alderman O'Connor 
01:59:11 >> I rise in support of the resolution. I think if you think about 
01:59:20 Chris's tenure here, you have to think about all of the personalities 
01:59:21 he's had to deal with during the course of his time here. Councils 
01:59:32 have a collective personality and they always have 50 individual 
01:59:37 personalities. Each time there is a new Council coming. Some people 
01:59:42 are gifted and every once in a while when there is a retirement 
01:59:48 resolution, you will see the number of aldermen and the number of 
01:59:54 aldermen that could stand is unanimous. It is a gift when you can 
01:59:59 make everybody in this chamber feel special and feel that you have 
02:00:08 been their partner in what they are trying to accomplish. You have 
02:00:13 had the ability to partner with all of us and make us feel as if you 
02:00:20 were giving us attention that nobody else could get. I used to stand 
02:00:30 up and think this person has been nice to everybody and I always 
02:00:31 thought it was because it was me that you stand up and realize that a 
02:00:34 person who has the gift that can make everybody feel special is 
02:00:43 themselves a special person. I've enjoyed our partnership. I wish you 
02:00:50 and your family in your retirement enjoyment. I wish you a long 
02:00:55 retirement. I have to tell you, if we are doing a job description to 
02:01:08 find the person who takes your place, my point would be you take a 
02:01:09 picture of you and slap it into the page and that is the job 
02:01:17 description. Find Chris two and put him in the spot because it has 
02:01:23 been a pleasure working with you and I wish you all the best 
02:01:25 >> Alderman Osterman 
02:01:26 >> I too want to be recognized in supporting and thanking Chris. 
02:01:35 Alderman O'Connor talked about how he made all 50 of us worked well 
02:01:39 with us but you help us with our staff and ultimately help Chicago. 
02:01:51 You had a hand in helping us run our offices to make sure it was run 
02:01:52 efficiently which helps us serve the people say you had a role in 
02:01:55 that. I want to echo everything said today, I really appreciate your 
02:01:59 professionalism, your service to the city and wish you health and 
02:02:03 happiness moving forward God bless you 
02:02:04 >> Aldermen [Indiscernible] 
02:02:11 >> Thank you. Chris, thank you very much for everything and best of 
02:02:12 luck to you 
02:02:13 >> Alderman O'Shea 
02:02:14 >> Thank you. I rise in support of the resolution. Chris, you are a 
02:02:28 gentleman and [Indiscernible] and thank you for your help not only 
02:02:35 eight years as aldermen but having known you for almost 20 years. I'm 
02:02:41 proud to say he is a resident of my community but I'm more proud to 
02:02:42 say you are a friend. Thank you for everything and best of luck 
02:02:47 >> Alderman Dowell 
02:02:49 >> Thank you Madam Chair. I wanted to add my voice to the chorus of 
02:02:59 people congratulating you today and say simply on behalf of Allison, 
02:03:05 Brian, Nate and Thomas, we thank you so much for your service and 
02:03:10 helping our office, God bless you and we wish you the best making 
02:03:16 your transition into retirement thank you Chris 
02:03:17 >> Alderman Lopez 
02:03:18 >> Thank you. Chris on behalf of not only my staff but also 
02:03:27 [Indiscernible] I want to thank you for getting to know you not only 
02:03:28 professionally but as a human being. You are awesome. Quite simply 
02:03:36 put. I know that as you plan your second career, or your second home 
02:03:47 I should say, that retirement is a blessing and a curse. I'm actually 
02:03:55 concerned because I think there must be a competition going on in the 
02:03:58 clerk's office because I think back to when the irreplaceable 
02:04:05 [Indiscernible] left, almost everyone in the room stood up and here 
02:04:08 we are doing it again for one of her coworkers which is you. I hope 
02:04:15 no one is keeping track of the personal competition between you and 
02:04:22 Tony to see how many aldermen will speak today but I think you are 
02:04:27 tied because your influence was monumental here in this office in 
02:04:31 your role in your impact not only on the city but personally for many 
02:04:37 of us, and across communities with you cannot be understated and 
02:04:45 cannot be valued enough. From the bottom of my heart thank you and I

02:05:16 said Chris. The last 20 years, you have been nothing but an exemplary 
02:05:27 and extraordinary person to myself and staff and we want to 
02:05:28 congratulate you on your retirement and wish you well. Thank you 
02:05:29 >> Alderman Sposato 
02:05:41 >> Thank you. I support this resolution but I have one problem with 
02:05:47 it Madam President, I believe it is about 10 pages short, this 
02:05:55 resolution. I'm not sure who wrote it but I was not consulted as many 
02:05:59 of my colleagues weren't so Chris it's 10 pages short. You have no 
02:06:03 idea the impact you've had on many of us when we first came in and 
02:06:11 the help you were. We will say the same thing everyone else says. My 
02:06:13 staff is watching and they want me to thank you. It was a pleasure 
02:06:26 coming down to talk to you, we had many like views and it was fun to 
02:06:27 chat to politics with you and even your mom is getting loved today 
02:06:28 because somebody thought she was your wife. Mom be proud of your son, 
02:06:35 his mother-in-law. Sister-in-law, I'm sorry. Everybody is getting

02:07:13 office. I want to thank you. During my tenure you've always been 
02:07:22 extraordinarily helpful to me and my staff, always available, always 
02:07:28 present and I've really appreciated it and you are going to be a very 
02:07:33 very hard person to replace. Good luck clerk Valencia

02:08:04 wish you all the best of luck in the future and I hope only good 
02:08:09 things come your way. Take care

02:08:18 >> Thank you. I really was not going to go and echo the comments of 
02:08:24 my colleagues.. I've been in the Council for 16 years and I've 
02:08:26 learned some new things today. I'm surprised. I did not know you were 
02:08:36 married. I just wanted to put it on the record that I saw your 
02:08:43 expression and you turn to be read so we all get it. That's the 
02:08:46 reason I had to speak up. After thinking about it, you are married to 
02:08:56 your work, you are married to your work. You have dedicated your life 
02:09:01 to this job as a public servant. You've been a role model for any 
02:09:09 public service employee. On behalf of the presidency in my office, I 
02:09:12 want to wish you the best and there is still time to get married 
02:09:21 Chris 
02:09:22 >> Alderman King 
02:09:27 >> Thank you. I want to thank you for your service. The only thing I 
02:09:36 can add to all of the sentiments out there is I firmly believe that 
02:09:41 all the positive energy you put out on the earth could come back to 
02:09:44 you. Be prepared for all of that positive energy to come back to you. 
02:09:49 Thank you for your service.

02:10:41 ensure that on behalf of the 11th Ward, I want to thank you 
02:10:49 >> Chris I'm speaking on behalf of the entire city Council. I wanted 
02:10:50 to share a few things at one point Chris told me he was in full 
02:10:56 crisis mode, I did not believe that because he seemed so called about 
02:11:05 any of the issues we have but I can assure you that my staff is in 
02:11:06 full crisis mode knowing you are going to retire. My chief of staff 
02:11:09 especially is beside herself with a hotline to your office and we 
02:11:14 want to thank you for all the work you have given us over the years.

02:18:56 [Indiscernible] assembled this 23rd day of January 2019 hereby honor 
02:19:03 the life and memory and be it further resolved that suitable copies 
02:19:04 of the resolution will be presented to the family as a token of our 
02:19:07 sympathy and esteem 
02:19:08 >> Alderman Arena 
02:19:12 >> Thank you. I will say a few words and if anyone wants to speak I 
02:19:16 reserve the right to close. I met George, a neighbor of mine who 
02:19:23 lives a block away with his family when I was canvassing for my first 
02:19:33 term as alderman in 2010. He invited me in and we sat down and I 
02:19:37 could tell right away that this was not just another neighbor, 
02:19:43 another man. A wealth of information, knowledge and history of 
02:19:48 Chicago. We talked for over an hour on that visit. I think I left 
02:19:52 that day with the entire copy of the CTU contract that he helped work 
02:20:02 on for CTU. I think all of us on this floor have folks who have been 
02:20:12 instrumental in some aspect of Chicago's history or politics or 
02:20:17 success and George was that person in the 45th Ward to me. He was a 
02:20:25 constant mentor. He challenged me at every turn as I'm sure he did so 
02:20:30 many others in his life. His kids could shake their head yes. In the 
02:20:42 resolution, he was a Chicago teacher journalist union leader who 
02:20:49 fought to improve the lives of many thousands of Chicago people. 
02:20:52 Those words give us a glimpse of the effect he had and the connection 
02:20:58 he has to Chicago's history, of unions, of fairness and equity in the 
02:21:03 fight that goes on today. I'm very proud to have known George, to 
02:21:12 know Sharon, and Samuel and Josh who are here today. Sharon in her 
02:21:18 own right is a teacher and editor of the Star newspaper. I know the 
02:21:23 boys are going to carry on George's legacy. Sharon and I were talking 
02:21:31 before this, that George was a great man and there are too few in 
02:21:35 this world and we lose them too soon. It's an honor to have known him 
02:21:42 into be in this position to recognize his contribution. 
02:21:47 >> Alderman Garza 
02:21:52 >> Thank you. Sharon, Sam, Josh, I was privileged to know your 
02:22:00 husband and dad. George was a force to be reckoned with. George was a 
02:22:07 presence that when you were in a room and he was there, you knew he 
02:22:09 was there. The thing I loved most about him is you never compromised 
02:22:17 his integrity ever. He stood for what he believed in and he would 
02:22:21 never let go. He was like a pitbull but in a good way. He always 
02:22:25 fought for the working class, always. You should be proud of your dad 
02:22:31 because he left a legacy of fighters, not just in the Chicago 
02:22:36 teachers Union but throughout Chicago. Sharon, I know my heart broke 
02:22:42 when I heard of his passing but I feel really lucky to have known him 
02:22:47 and have him in my life as well. My heart goes out to your family. I 
02:22:57 feel one of the privileged few to have been touched by his greatness. 
02:22:58 Thank you for being here today

02:23:22 >> Over decades to expose injustice and speak truth and power. 
02:23:36 [Indiscernible] as the editor of substance for years I'm sure often 
02:23:42 was a difficult task but a worthwhile project [Indiscernible] he 
02:23:52 consistently spoke boldly on behalf of equity and justice 
02:23:59 [Indiscernible] on behalf of [Indiscernible] [Speaker off mic] 
02:24:06 >> My parents worked for the Chicago public schools many decades ago 
02:24:10 and as a child [Indiscernible] [Speaker off mic] 
02:24:11 >> It wasn't until years later [Indiscernible] 
02:25:17 >> To the Schmidt family, I speak on behalf of the entire city 
02:25:27 Council, we extend our deepest sympathy on your loss. Alderman Arena, 
02:25:28 can I have a motion for passage? 
02:25:29 >> Hearing no objection 
02:25:34 >> So ordered 
02:25:35 >> Alderman Dowell 
02:25:36 >> Do you want to suspend the rules? 
02:25:55 >> I'd like to suspend the rules [Indiscernible] 
02:25:56 >> Hearing no objection, so ordered 
02:25:57 >> Resolution demanding the federal government reopen for the safety 
02:26:25 and well-being for the residents of Chicago. The Chicago is the 
02:26:26 third-largest city, federal employee and contractors and residents 
02:26:27 have a lasting impact for the well-being and economic health of the 
02:26:28 city. The Chicagoland area produces an annual regional growth of over 
02:26:31 $609 billion and where as federal employees require paycheck 
02:26:36 [Indiscernible] the health safety and well-being for residents are 
02:26:45 imminent risk. Whereas the devastating effect of the federal 
02:26:46 government has lasting consequences on working families across the 
02:26:49 city of Chicago. The city of Chicago has two international airports, 
02:26:54 according to the city Department of aviation, in November 2018 O'Hare 
02:27:03 salt 800,000 operations and 76 million passengers. Midway salt 
02:27:08 240,000 aircraft operations and 20 million passengers. Whereas 
02:27:13 air-traffic controllers and transportation security agents are 
02:27:19 federal employees, [Indiscernible] whereas the United States 
02:27:25 Department of Homeland Security and department Department of Defense 
02:27:34 work in concert with various agencies in Illinois Cook County city of 
02:27:35 Chicago keep residents safe from cyber attack domestic and import 
02:27:36 attack. Be it resolved that the city Council assembled this 23rd day 
02:27:44 of January two hereby call the United States Senate to pass 
02:27:52 legislation to fully fund the government be it further resolved that 
02:27:53 a copy of the resolution be prepared and presented to the United 
02:27:54 States Senators. 
02:27:55 >> Alderman Dowell 
02:28:00 >> Thank you. Thank you for reading that, thank you Ms. president. I 
02:28:09 want to thank my colleagues for signing onto the resolution. Although 
02:28:14 it is mostly symbolic because we don't have control over the federal 
02:28:19 government, I think it's important we ask our senators to pass 
02:28:24 resolution to fully fund the federal government. When has the 
02:28:26 president in our modern-day times held an entire country hostage 
02:28:34 because he can't get his way? I can't recall such an occasion in my 
02:28:40 lifetime. Federal employees have not been paid in a month. Every day 
02:28:44 that we go without a solution to the federal shutdown, we are 
02:28:54 throwing thousands of people and their families into a state of 
02:28:58 financial insecurity. The calls into various offices to take sick 
02:29:14 time or vacation or people not coming in to work are going 
02:29:15 [Indiscernible] and this lack of federal services affects the health 
02:29:16 safety and well-being of our city. Especially are two international 
02:29:22 airports, O'Hare and Midway. We are taking the time today as a city 
02:29:24 Council to send a message to McConnell and all of those Republicans 
02:29:35 people in Washington that we want a solution to the federal shutdown 
02:29:44 because it is impacting our citizens for the city of Chicago and 
02:29:48 endangers our ability to maintain a healthy and safe city. Thank you 
02:29:55 for your time today on this manner and I'm hoping there will be 
02:29:58 others that will speak 
02:29:59 >> Alderman Taliaferro 
02:30:08 >> Thank you. Let me say, thank you Alderman Dowell for your 
02:30:16 leadership on the manner and I'd like my name to be added in support 
02:30:17 >> Alderman Lopez 
02:30:24 >> Thank you. I want to also thank Chairman Tao for bringing this 
02:30:33 resolution before us. In my previous life, I worked at an airport, I 
02:30:39 worked in the aviation industry, and industry federally regulated and 
02:30:46 relies on the federal government, the transportation security 
02:30:47 administration officers to keep our airports, flights and citizenry 
02:30:56 save. They have seen a threefold increase in the amount of sick calls 
02:31:04 as a result of the shutdown as it enters into his 30 day because the 
02:31:07 president trumps temper tantrum. At some point, this will come to a 
02:31:12 head. We have seen this now as a cargo jet crashed in this country 
02:31:23 and the NTSB was unable to secure the site because of a shut down. 
02:31:24 It's only a matter of time for the whole aviation industry comes to a 
02:31:32 screeching halt because no one will be left to secure the airports 
02:31:35 and screen the cargo or to ensure the passengers are there because 
02:31:36 they are on a flight and not terrorize the country. Once that 
02:31:46 happens, this country will come to a screeching halt quickly. We 
02:31:51 forget how much we rely on the aviation industry to not only move 
02:31:56 people but to move commerce, to keep these United States and the 
02:32:04 21st-century. In because the president trumps actions, we are about 
02:32:07 to make a leap in the wrong direction. We do not have the authority 
02:32:16 to compel President Trump or his federal legislators to do anything. 
02:32:23 For two years, they were in control of all houses, all branches of 
02:32:25 government and did nothing. Now they are playing games. They are 
02:32:28 playing games with people's lives, locally with the 800,000 people out 
02:32:35 of a job, forced to go to food pantries and rely on the consideration 
02:32:45 of others to live and also to put the 300 million people in this 
02:32:46 country in jeopardy in short order. We must continue to raise the 
02:32:51 alarm bells as the city Council house does time and again and I'm 
02:32:55 proud to support the resolution and I urge all 50 of us to continue 
02:33:02 the fight every day. This is not leadership, this is a disaster and 
02:33:09 we must down firm against the disaster at every turn. 
02:33:10 >> Alderman Dowell 
02:33:20 >> Thank you. I would like this resolution although I know we have a 
02:33:25 time element, I understand procedurally [Speaker off mic] if that's 
02:33:31 okay with the chairman [Indiscernible]
