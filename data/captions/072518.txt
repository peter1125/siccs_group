00:04:52 THE FIRST SPEAKER IS AMZAYA JAZZWELL. 
00:05:01 >> HELLO. 
00:05:07 GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, MAYOR EMANUEL. 
00:05:20 THE LORD HAS BROUGHT IN THE WORLD OF DECISION. 
00:05:24 HE SAID EITHER YOU CHOOSE LIFE OR DEATH. 
00:05:27 EITHER YOU CHOOSE THE BLESSING OR THE CURSE. 
00:05:29 HE SAYS IF YOU CHOOSE LIFE, THAT HE WILL ESTABLISH YOUR POWER. 
00:05:36 HE, WILL ESTABLISH YOUR POWER. 
00:05:37 AND THAT HE WILL GIVE YOU THE DESIRE OF YOUR HEART. 
00:05:42 IF YOU CHOOSE DEATH, HE WILL NOT PASSOVER YOUR FAMILY. 
00:05:46 HE WILL NOT PASSOVER YOUR BUSINESS, KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT YOU WILL BE 
00:05:50 DESTROYED. 
00:05:55 NOW LET ME REMIND YOU, OF MITENIA, YOU REMEMBER AT THE--TENESER 
00:06:08 CHANGED HIS NAME. 
00:06:12 NOW IF YOU REMEMBER, HE CAME INTO THE VALLEY DECISION TOO. 
00:06:19 HE COULD EITHER CHOOSE TO LISTEN TO THE PROPHET JEREMIAH OR CHOOSE TO 
00:06:24 GO WITH HIS OWN WILL. 
00:06:26 IN THE END, DESPITE WHAT THE PROPHET TOLD HIM, HE DECIDED TO GO THE 
00:06:36 PROPHET INTO THE DUNGEON TO GET RID OF HIM TO COMPLETELY DESTROY HIM. 
00:06:42 HOWEVER, THE ETHIOPIAN CAME TO HIM, THE ETHIOPIAN SLAVE AND TOLD HIM, 
00:06:47 WAIT A MINUTE, YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT THIS. 
00:06:51 THIS IS THE PROPHET OF YA. 
00:06:56 SO AS HISTORY TELLS US, HE DECIDED TO TAKE PROPHET JEREMIAH OUT OF 
00:07:04 THE DUNGEON. 
00:07:05 HE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE. 
00:07:07 AND THE PROPHET TOLD HIM THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE THIS, YAW CHOSE 
00:07:20 MERCY AND GIVEN YOU ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY. 
00:07:22 ONE OPPORTUNITY ONLY. 
00:07:26 YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO SERVE YAW, YOU KNOW FROM 
00:07:33 YOUR YOUTH, YOU ARE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR IT IN WAY THAT'S MANY OTHERS 
00:07:36 ARE NOT. 
00:07:39 YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE. 
00:07:46 WHAT IS YOUR CHOICE, WILL YOU CHOOSE LIFE, OR WILL YOU CHOOSE DEATH? 
00:08:01 THANK YOU. 
00:08:02 >> THANK YOU. 
00:08:05 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN CANASARA. 
00:08:09 >> GOOD MORNING. 
00:08:11 STICK ON A RELIGIOUS THING. 
00:08:13 SOME MAY KNOW SOME MAY NOT. 
00:08:15 FOR THE LAST 30 PLUS YEARS, THE CARDINAL RESIDENTS ON NORTH AVENUE 
00:08:21 HAS MAINTAINED 24-HOUR POLICE PROTECTION WITH ON DUTY POLICE OFFICERS. 
00:08:32 THAT'S AN APPROXIMATION OF A MILLION DOLLARS. 
00:08:35 IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S A CLEAR VIOLATION OF TAXPAYER STATE. 
00:08:42 I COULD HOPE THAT THIS HOLD COUNCIL WOULD HOLD SOMEBODY RESPONSIBLE 
00:08:46 FOR THAT NONSENSE. 
00:08:47 IT'S AT LEAST UPWARDS OF 20 MILLION DOLLARS PLUS AND IT CAN GO FOR 
00:08:52 THE POLICE PENSIONS THAT YOU FAILED TO FUND FOR A LONG TIME. 
00:08:57 SECONDLY, THE DEBACLE OF THE RYAN, TWO WEEKS AGO, NONE OF YOU IN THIS 
00:09:03 CHAMBER INCLUDING THE MAYOR, CAN CIRCUMVENT LAW. 
00:09:07 IT'S ILLEGAL FOR PEDESTRIANS TO BE ON THE STREET. 
00:09:13 AND FOR NIF YOU TO HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE IT'S DISGUSTING. 
00:09:20 EVERYONE ON THAT EXPRESSWAY WAS TRESPASSING. 
00:09:27 AND THE FACT THAT THE--I'M CALLING FOR HIS IMMEDIATE REMOVAL. 
00:09:31 HE KNOW LONGER HAS THE BACK OF IMAGINE OR OF MEN AND WOMEN OF THE 
00:09:34 CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT. 
00:09:36 HE'S THE SUBJECT OF ON GOING COMPLAINT FOR HIS BEHAVIOR THAT DAY. 
00:09:40 AND ALSO YOU TALK ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY THERE WAS A POLICE REPORT 
00:09:45 GENERATED, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO IT? 
00:09:48 IT WAS SCRUBBED FROM THE SYSTEM, THE REPORT NUMBER IS BASICALLY A 
00:09:53 BLANK FILE NOU. START WITH YOUR SUPERINTENDENT, HE NEEDS TO BE 
00:09:56 REPLACED. 
00:10:02 >> THANK YOU. 
00:10:04 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MELVIN BAYER. 
00:10:10 >> GOOD MORNING, COUNCILMEMBERS.

00:11:04 SITES, LET'S START WITH A AREA WHERE A LOT OF VIOLENCE IS HAPPENING 
00:11:07 ESPECIALLY IN THE CITY. 
00:11:09 LET'S TARGET ONE OF THE MAYORS AND LET'S GO RIGHT AT THEM KIDS AND 
00:11:13 SAY HEY, WE HAVE A CONSTRUCTION JOB.

00:19:33 DOWNTOWN, TURNING TO PEABODY NEARLY HIT SEVERAL PEDESTRIANS THAT'S 
00:19:35 WHEN I NOTICED THERE WAS TWO PEOPLE IN THE CARRIAGE. 
00:19:40 ANOTHER CARRIAGE DRIVER TRIED TO CHASE THE DRIVERLESS CARRIAGE BUT IT 
00:19:46 WAS GOING TOO FAST, LEAVING A WOMAN FACE FIRST ON THE PAVEMENT. 
00:19:51 ANOTHER ARTICLE, FRENCH QUARTER, CARRYING TEN PEOPLE FLIPS OVER.

00:20:12 NINE PEOPLE RANGE FROMING ONE-YEAR-OLD TO 30 WERE TRANSPORT TODAY 
00:20:16 LOCAL HOSPITAL. 
00:20:19 THIS HAPPENED JUST AN HOUR AWAY FROM CHICAGO WHICH ILLUSTRATES THAT 
00:20:25 NO CITY OR AREA IS IMMUNE TO THESE INJURIES. 
00:20:31 MANY HORSES DIED OR SERIOUSLY INJURED IN THOSE BUT THE FINE HEADLINES 
00:20:36 INVOLVED HUMAN SUFFERING. 
00:20:39 JULY 11, COURSE MAN KILLED IN THREE COURSE IN ACCIDENT, ESCAPES 
00:20:45 INJURY IN RUN AWAY HORSE CARRIAGE. 
00:20:48 APRIL 10, AMERICAN COUPLE KILLS AFTER HORSE CARRIAGE CRASHES IN 
00:20:51 IRELAND. 
00:20:55 THESE ARE THE ACCIDENTS THAT WE'RE AWARE OF, THERE ARE MANY MORE THAT 
00:21:00 DON'T MAKE THE NEWS. 
00:21:03 AND BACK IN FANGT A POLICEMAN TOLD US HOW HE WITNESSED A HORSE 
00:21:08 COLLAPSE IN JUNE. 
00:21:12 IT TOOK HANDLERS ABOUT FIVE MINUTES OR SO TO GET THE HORSEBACK ON ITS 
00:21:15 FAOE. THE POOR HORSE. 
00:21:17 CHICAGO HAS HAD AT LEAST FIVE ACCIDENTS THAT WE KNOW OF SINCE 2014, 
00:21:22 THAT'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY. 
00:21:27 THAT'S 100% UNNECESSARY, ESPECIALLY WHEN FOUR CHILDREN HAD TO BE 
00:21:30 RUSHED TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM. 
00:21:32 LUCKILY THEY WERE OKAY, BUT WHAT IF THE OPPOSITE WERE TRUE. 
00:21:36 WOULD CHICAGO WOULD HAVE PASSED A HORSE BAN THEN? 
00:21:39 HOW MANY MORE DEATHS AND INJURIES MUST OCCUR BEFORE CHICAGO CREATES 
00:21:46 THE BAN. 
00:21:49 THIS HIGHLY DANGEROUS ACTIVITY. 
00:21:52 PLEASE REMEMBER THESE CARRIAGES HAVE ZERO SAFETY PRECAUTIONS, NO SEAT 
00:21:59 BELTS, NO AIRBAGS AND ANY CHILD CAN TAKE A RIDE WITHOUT ANY SAFETY 
00:22:03 SEATS. 
00:22:07 OUR CITY DOES NOT MEAN A UGLY HORSE CAMER RIDE. 
00:22:13 PLEASE VOTE IN FAVOR OF IDA B DRIVES. 
00:22:17 THANK YOU. 
00:22:20 >>, THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MIRA. 
00:22:27 >> GOOD MOANSINGER MAYOR EMANUEL MY NAME IS MARLA ROSE, I LOVE TO 
00:22:32 COME TO CHICAGO BUT I AVOID THE MILE BECAUSE OF THE HORSE CARRIAGE 
00:22:37 DEPRESSES GREATLY. 
00:22:43 IN MARCH 2018, A HORSE WAS STANDING LIFELESS IN THE RAIN. 
00:22:51 NOT ONLY IS THIS INCREDIBLY INHUMANE BUT IT'S ILLEGAL. 
00:22:56 THE DRIVER WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN YET CHICAGO STATES DRIVERS MUST 
00:23:02 REMAIN WITH THE CARRIAGES AT ALL TIMES HAVING CONTROL BIT HORSE BY 
00:23:07 HAVE THING REIGNS IN HAND. 
00:23:09 THE FACT THAT THESE HORSE WRZ COMPLETELY UNATTENDED IS AN ACCIDENT 
00:23:12 WAIT TO GO HAPPEN. 
00:23:14 PLEASE REMEMBER THAT HORSES ARE PREY ANIMALS AND CAN REDUCE REDUCE 
00:23:22 SPOOK. 
00:23:25 ALSO AN UMBRELLA OPENING IS WHAT PROMTED THE LATEST HORSE SPOOK IN 
00:23:31 NEW YORK. 
00:23:35 HORSE EXPERTS INCLUDING VET IN AER I DON'T KNOW HAVE EXPRESSED 
00:23:39 CONCERN ABOUT THE ANTIQUE CARRIAGE WHO WAS STANDING IN THE RAIN WITH 
00:23:44 THEIR IRREGULAR POS TOUR. 
00:23:46 HERE ARE A FEW OF THE QUOTES THAT THEY GAVE US, THE STANCE THAT THE 
00:23:51 HORSE HAS ADOPTED IN ORDER TO RELIEF PAIN. 
00:23:57 THIS STANCE IS CALLED GOAT ON A ROCK STANCE. 
00:24:01 TWO, HE IS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH YOU B*U IT COULD BE HIS HOOFS OR SIDE 
00:24:06 JOINTS, THIS IS SAD SO SEE, THE PUBLIC DOES NOT KNOW ANY BERT, THEY 
00:24:11 JUST SEE A PRETTY HORSE. 
00:24:14 THREE, HIS FRONT FEET ARE FAR TOO FAR, THIS STANCE IS CHARACTERISTIC 
00:24:21 WITH HORSES WITH VENICULAR A PAINFUL CONDITION WHICH IS CAUSED BY 
00:24:25 SHOING. 
00:24:29 THE FRONT LEGS ARE GOING BACK AND THE HIND LEGS ARE GOING UNDER. 
00:24:34 THE NEXT QUOTE, I AGREE THAT THE STANCE ON THIS HORSE APPEARS 
00:24:39 ABNORMAL, HE COULD BE SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC PAIN CAUSING HIM TO 
00:24:44 STAND IN A PARTICULAR WAY. 
00:24:46 SINCE HORSES ARE NOT BEING MONITORED THEY ARE NOT GETTING THE PROPER 
00:24:51 CARE OR VETERINARY OVERSIGHT. 
00:24:54 A PROGRESSIVE SOCIETY, TRIES TO PREVENT UNNECESSARY SUFFERING. 
00:25:00 PLEASE MAKE CHICAGO A KINDER CITY. 
00:25:06 AND I URGE YOU TO SPORT IDA B WELLS ORDINANCE AND ALSO I'M ASKING 
00:25:21 MAYOR EMANUAL. 
00:25:24 >> NEXT SPEAKER IS JODI WATTACRE. 
00:25:31 >> GOOD MORNING, MAYOR EMANUEL AND CITY COUNCIL. 
00:25:34 I'M WITH THE CHICAGO ALLIANCE OF ANIMALS. 
00:25:38 CHICAGO HORSE COMPANIES HAVE FORCED THEIR BELOVED TO WORK IN 90 PLUS 
00:25:45 HEAT THIS YEAR ALONE AS WELL AS LAST SUMMER. 
00:25:49 IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT NEITHER THE HUMID OR THE ASPHALT TEMPERATURE 
00:25:54 CAN BE 50 TIMES HOTTER THAN THE AIR TEMPERATURE IS EVER TAKEN INTO 
00:25:59 CONSIDERATION AND THIS IS WHERE THE HORSE RIGHT SIDE WALKING. 
00:26:04 THE LAW STATES, NORTHERNLY ISLAND IS ON THE LAKE AND LIKELY COOLER 
00:26:07 THAN WHERE THE HORSES WALK AND WORK. 
00:26:10 THIS IS NOT ONLY INCREDIBLY INHUMANE AND IT'S INLEGAL. 
00:26:21 THEY ARE TASK WITH THE--ONCE AGAIN THE AGENCY IS FAILING. 
00:26:29 THEY STILL HAVE NO INVESTIGATORS WORKING ON WEEKENDS TO MAKE SURE THE 
00:26:32 HORSE RIGHT SIDE NOT WORKED IN TEMPERATURES ABOVE THE LEGAL LIMITS OR 
00:26:37 TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WORKERS HAVE NOT WORKING THEM LONGER HOURS. 
00:26:43 I CALLED SEVERAL TIME TO SEE IF THEY THE HORSES ARE GOING TO BE 
00:26:48 MONITORED IN THE HEAT. 
00:26:52 I GET GET RESPONSE. 
00:26:55 THIS IS NOT AND SHOULD NOT BE THE JOB OF CONCERNED CITIZENS. 
00:27:00 IT'S SIGNATURE TO POINT OUT THAT NEITHER THE CITY MONITOR OR ENFORCE 
00:27:08 THE HORSES LAW. 
00:27:10 HAS INFORMED ME EARLY THIS YEAR THAT NONE OF THE CARRIAGE COMPANIES 
00:27:14 HAD TRY TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW OR PROVIDED MATERIALS THAT THE CITY 
00:27:19 HAD REQUESTED IN ORDER TO DO SO, EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD PLENTY OF TIME 
00:27:23 TO DO SO. 
00:27:28 WE KNOW THAT BACP HAS SETTLED WITH ALMOST TWO OF THE COMPANIES AND 
00:27:32 I'M CERTAINLY THAT THEY WILL SETTLE WITH THE THIRD COMPANY ON AUGUST 
00:27:34 FIRST. 
00:27:36 BUT WE HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT HAS BECOME WITH THE IETIZATIONS AND 
00:27:41 UPWARDS OF $2000 IN FINES. 
00:27:44 BUT WE DONOUGH THAT CARRIAGE COMPANIES ARE STILL BREAKING THE LAW. 
00:27:47 MYSELF AND OTHERS HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF HOURS DOING OF OUR OWN TIME 
00:27:56 DOING B.C. TA'S JOB FOR THEM. 
00:28:03 THANK YOU, ALDERMAN REILLY AND THE OTHERS WHO SUPPORT. 
00:28:07 FINALLY I'M ASKING EMMA MITS TO PUT THIS ON THE AGENDA AND RECOMMENDS 
00:28:11 ITS PASSAGE IN THE COUNCIL. 
00:28:12 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION TODAY. 
00:28:15 AND I ALSO URGE YOU TO SPORT IDA B WELLS ORDINANCE. 
00:28:19 THANK YOU. 
00:28:21 >> THANK YOU, THE NEXT SPEAKER IS GEORGE. 
00:28:44 >> SERVICE, AND SERVICE. 
00:28:47 I AM ANTI ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT INVADING OUR GLOBAL. 
00:28:53 ILLEGAL MEANS AGAINST THE LAW! 
00:28:55 LOOK IT UP IN YOUR DICTIONARY. 
00:28:58 LEGAL MEAN WITHIN THE LAW AND ANY FEW MINUTES AFTER MY THREE MINUTES 
00:29:04 IS UP, THEY'RE GOING TO SAY SIT DOWN MR. BLAKE MOORE BECAUSE THE LAW 
00:29:09 SAYS THREE MINUTES. 
00:29:13 I'M APPALLED THAT INVASION OF PEOPLE THAT DO NOT RESPECT OTHER 
00:29:19 PEOPLE'S BOARD, DO NOT WANT TO GO THROUGH IMMIGRATION AND 
00:29:22 NATURALIZATION. 
00:29:24 DO NOT WANT TO STAND IN LINE. 
00:29:29 WANT TO SKIP. 
00:29:31 WE ARE A NATION OF LAW. 
00:29:35 SO THESE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE BLACK 
00:29:39 COMMUNITY. 
00:29:54 BLACK PEOPLE USED TO COOK. 
00:29:57 THEY USE TODAY WAIT TABLE, WASH DISHES. 
00:30:00 NOT IN THAT INDUSTRY ANYMORE. 
00:30:02 THERE HAVE BEEN AND YOU KNOW, BLACK LEADERSHIP IS HOLLER. 
00:30:10 HOW DOES IT BENEFIT YOUR COMMUNITY WHEN THEY EVEN WANT TO VOTE. 
00:30:17 THEY ILLEGALS ARE GOING TO VOTE. 
00:30:21 HE GET DRIVER'S LICENSES. 
00:30:23 THEY GET A LITTLE CARD THAT SAYS THEIR CITIZENS OF CHICAGO. 
00:30:27 BUT THAT CARD THAT THEY SAY THEY ARE GREEN CARD THAT THEY ARE LEGAL 
00:30:33 AND CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES, THEY TALK ABOUT TRUMP. 
00:30:36 WE GOT A LOT OF TRUMPS RIGHT HERE. 
00:30:42 RIGHT HERE IN OUR CITY. 
00:30:43 WE GOT TRUMP. 
00:30:50 THE DEMOCRATIC MACHINE, IS ALARMED. 
00:30:55 IT HAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION, 
00:30:59 IN-HOUSING. 
00:31:00 IN SCHOOL. 
00:31:02 WHEN THEY COME, THEY COMPETE, THEY CLOSE UP THE BLACK SCHOOLS AND 
00:31:06 OPEN UP THESE OTHER SCHOOLS FOR THESE ILLEGALS, THEY GOT TO EDUCATE 
00:31:09 THEM. 
00:31:12 AND THEN THEY GET HEALTHCARE, I'M POOR AND I STAND IN LINE. 
00:31:16 I GOT TO PAY. 
00:31:25 WHEN SOME OF THEM DON'T HAVE TO PAY. 
00:31:30 SOME ARE SUBSIDIZING THEIR LEGALS. 
00:31:31 LOOK IT UP. 
00:31:32 LEGAL WITHIN THE LAW. 
00:31:34 ILLEGAL IS NOT THE LAW. 
00:31:37 CITIZENSHIP IS VERY IMPORTANT. 
00:31:38 >> THANK YOU. 
00:31:44 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS SCOTT BUR. 
00:31:51 >> MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL AND MR. MAYOR. 
00:31:55 MY NAME IS SCOTT BURKE AND I'M A RESIDENT OF THE PARK AND 33 WARD. 
00:32:02 THE CITY HAS BEEN REMISS AND DER LEKT IN THEIR PARKS ON ROAD AND 
00:32:10 TRAFFIC SIGNS. 
00:32:12 I MEAN THE IMPORTANT ONES SUCH AS STOP SIGNS AND YIELD SIGNS. 
00:32:16 I WALK THROUGH MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND JUST ABOUT ANY CHICAGO 
00:32:21 NEIGHBORHOOD, WILL FIND THESE STOP SIGNS BLOCKED BY BRANCHES THAT 
00:32:25 HAVE NOT BEEN TRIMMED. 
00:32:27 FOR EXAMPLE ON THE NORTH SIDE ARE OBSTRUCTED BY BRANCH AND FOLIAGE. 
00:32:37 SOUTHWEST CORN OF LAWNDALE AND LELAND. 
00:32:39 SOUTHEAST CORNER OF LELAND AND KELDORE. 
00:32:44 SOUTHEAST CORNER OF SPRINGFIELD AND ANGELSLY. 
00:32:49 THESE EXAMPLES IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD ARE HEAVILY TRAVELED AND THIS IS 
00:32:53 THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. 
00:32:56 THIS IS PROBABLY A GREATER PROBLEM IN THE LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. 
00:33:02 EACH SIDE IS A DEDICATED MESSAGE TO THE DRIVER IN A HAZARD IS CREATED. 
00:33:08 I GIVE EXAMPLES OF JUST STOP LINES. 
00:33:10 BUT THIS LACK OF TREE TRIMMING PRESENTS A PROBLEM SUCH AS LOW 
00:33:19 BRANCHES, HITTING PEDESTRIANS. 
00:33:22 AN ALDERMAN ONCE TOLD ME THEY HAD LOW STAFF THE DUTIES ARE NOT 
00:33:26 PERFORMED WITH A CITY OF 10,856 SQUARE MILES. 
00:33:34 THIS BECOMES 3600 FOR EACH OF THE THREE STAFFERS. 
00:33:39 AND THUS TOTALLY INADEQUATE. 
00:33:43 THE CITY CAN IGNORE THIS PROBLEM AND ONE DAY A KID WILL GET KILLED 
00:33:47 AND THERE WILL BE A FALL GUY. 
00:33:49 LET US NOT FORGET THE LESSONS OF THE E2 NIGHTCLUB, THE PORCH COLLAPSE 
00:33:56 INCIDENT OR THE FLOODING OF THE TUNNELS IN 1990s WHEN SOMEBODY WAS 
00:34:02 NEEDED AND SOMEBODY WAS FIRED AS THE FALL GUY. 
00:34:08 BEING PROACTIVE WILL BE A TO MAKE SURE THESE OFFICES HAVE ADEQUATE 
00:34:14 STAFF. 
00:34:18 ANY LACK OF FUNLDS OR RESOURCES ARE SILLY BECAUSE THE CITY BECAUSE 
00:34:22 WHEN THE CITY NEEDS TO FIND MONEY FOR THE PROEJT, THE CITY WILL AND 
00:34:26 DOES FIND FUNDING. 
00:34:28 LET US LOOK AT THE EXAMPLE OF THE PLAN ELZ IN THE MIDDLE OF STREET OR 
00:34:35 STADIUM WHICH HAS A MARGINAL STR. 
00:34:37 IF THERE IS MONEY FOR THESE PROJECTS, THERE IS MONEY FOR PUBLIC 
00:34:41 SAFETY. 
00:34:44 PLEASE DO THE PROPER TREE TRIMMING BEFORE A CATASTROPHE OCCURS. 
00:34:47 THANK YOU. 
00:34:50 >> THANK YOU, THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JACKIE PAGE.

00:36:15 CITY, THE SPACE WE HAVE IS INADEQUATE. 
00:36:19 MORE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY TO TEACH 
00:36:26 RESPONSIBILITY AND EMPATHY. 
00:36:29 DATA HAS SHOWN IT REDUCES ANGER AND VIOLENCE IN STUDENTS AND IMPROVES 
00:36:34 ACADEMIC IMPROVEMENT. 
00:36:37 NY SCHOOLS HAVE EXPAND FROMED 7 TO 42 SCHOOLS. 
00:36:45 EXAMINER HAVING BREEDING LICENSES, PLEASE MAKE THE EFFORT TO STOP 
00:36:48 EXCESSIVE READING. 
00:36:49 IT CONTINUES TO BE A FINANCIAL DRAIN IN OUR SOCIETY AND PUSHES THOSE

00:36:55 PUTTING A NEW DIRECTOR IN PLACE WHO IS HONEST AND HAS COMPASSION AND 
00:36:59 BELIEVES IN THE WELL BEING OF ANIMALS AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY COME

01:12:37 FIGHTING. 
01:12:44 PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT THE FIRE POLL WAS INVENTED HERE

01:21:18 THAT'S WHAT IT IS. 
01:21:21 ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE I SAW IN UNIFORM AS A LITTLE BOY WAS MY 
01:21:27 BROTHER WHO CAME INTO MY HOME, IN A FIRE FIGHTER UNIFORM. 
01:21:36 YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AGO. 
01:21:39 AND I WAS ALWAYS IMPRESSED FROM THAT POINT ON. 
01:21:45 IT'S A DANGEROUS JOB, VERY DANGEROUS JOB, IN FACT, IN THOSE DAYS THEY 
01:21:54 DIDN'T HAVE MASKS. 
01:22:01 HOSPITALIZED AND BECAUSE OF LUNG PRFNLT ULTIMATELY, HE PASSED FROM 
01:22:05 LUNG CANCER. 
01:22:07 IT'S AN IMPORTANT JOB TO BE PROUD OF. 
01:22:11 SO WE ARE PROUD OF YOU EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. 
01:22:13 THANK YOU. 
01:22:16 >> ALDERMAN DAVID MOORE. 
01:22:19 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:22:21 I TOO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. 
01:22:25 WHERE THERE IS NO CONVICTIONER THE PEOPLE WILL CARRY. 
01:22:30 AND LIEUTENANT, YOU HAD THIS VISION AND THAT VISION IS REALIZED AND 
01:22:34 THE IMPORTANT THING IS BY YOU EXPOSING YOUNG PEOPLE TO THIS, THAT THE 
01:22:41 PEOPLE WILL NOT PERISH AS FIREFIGHTERS IN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. 
01:22:46 WE ALWAYS SAY AND THIS RINGS TRUE, YOUNG PEOPLE CANNOT BE WHAT THEY 
01:22:49 CANNOT SEE. 
01:22:51 AND PART OF YOUR VISION IS ALLOWING THEM TO SEE THAT THEY CAN BE 
01:22:56 FIREFIGHTERS, LEADER WITHIN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, A WHOLE SLEW OF 
01:23:01 PROFESSIONS WITHIN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. 
01:23:03 EVEN BEYOND JUST IN A FIRE FIGHTER. 
01:23:06 AND BY CREATING THIS AND ESTABLISHING THIS BRIGADE, IT ALLOWS THEM TO 
01:23:10 SEE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. 
01:23:13 I WANT TO COMMAND MY COLLEAGUE, ALDERMAN DERICK CURTIS FOR TAKING UP 
01:23:22 THIS NITION TIFF AND NOT JUST THAT, IT GIVES US THE SPACE WHERE WE 
01:23:28 CAN CONNECT AND HAVE FUN AND RELATE WITH OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN A MORE 
01:23:34 RELAXED ENVIRONMENT. 
01:23:35 I LOOK FORWARD TO SPENDING TIME AT THE FACILITY AND I COMMEND YOU ALL 
01:23:41 FOR THE EFFORT AND THE JOB THAT YOU'RE ALL DOING TO FURTHER AFRICAN 
01:23:43 AMERICANS WITHIN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. 
01:23:45 THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:23:50 >> ALDERMAN HARRIS. 
01:23:52 >> THANK YOU, I TOO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION AND 
01:23:56 CONGRATULATE YOU ALL. 
01:23:58 YOU KNOW, ALL THE KIDS I TALKED TO. 
01:24:01 EVEN IN THIS DAY AND AGE, IS ALWAYS STILL WANT TO BE A FIREMAN. 
01:24:07 AND SOMETIMES, SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE TIME THAT THEY WANT TO BE A 
01:24:11 FIREMAN AND THEY GET OLDER, THEY CHANGE THEIR MIND. 
01:24:15 AND SO WHAT I AM HOPING THAT THIS CENTER WILL DO IS HELP INSPIRE SOME 
01:24:23 YOUNGER PEOPLE TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR DESIRE TO BE A FIREMAN. 
01:24:27 ALDERMAN AUSTIN, I GO THROUGH THE BOX. 
01:24:30 AND I MADE IT OUT ALIVE. 
01:24:33 I THINK -- 
01:24:34 ~>> THE RECORD IS NOW CLEAR. 
01:24:37 >> THE RECORD IS CLEAR, THAT WAS HARD. 
01:24:41 IT SEEMS LIKE IT TOOK A REALLY REALLY LONG TIME. 
01:24:46 SO WHEN EVERYTHING IN YOUR BODY IS SCREAMING GET OUT, AND YOU'RE 
01:24:50 STILL ALL GOING IN. 
01:24:51 THAT IS AMAZING. 
01:24:56 FIRE KNOWS NO COLOR AND SMOKE KNOWS NO COLOR. 
01:25:00 SO I AM GLAD THAT YOU WILL ARE RECOGNIZING THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE 
01:25:08 DONE AND THE CONTRIBUTION YOU HAVE MADE TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT EVEN 
01:25:13 WHEN THEY DID NOT TREAT YOU THE WAY YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN TREATED. 
01:25:18 SO I AM GLAD TO SEE THIS. 
01:25:23 PLEASE TAKE YOUR MESSAGE THROUGHOUT THE CITY. 
01:25:26 ALL THE GIRLS AND BOYS NEED TO HEAR THAT.

01:26:35 BECAME FIREMAN.

01:28:40 >> I TOO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RIS LOSING. 
01:28:48 RESOLUTION. 
01:28:53 I WANT TO SAY JOB WELL DONE. 
01:29:01 MR. PRESIDENT, IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE, ONE THING I 
01:29:05 LEARNED THAT WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THE DUTIES OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. 
01:29:09 WE GO BEYOND WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THEM. 
01:29:13 THEY HAVE GONE BEYOND JUST THEIR DUTIES. 
01:29:17 I LOOK BACK RECENTLY WHEN WE RECOGNIZED SOME OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS 
01:29:22 IN THEIR RELIV EFFORTS IN PUERTO RICO. 
01:29:24 AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE RECOGNIZE TODAY THE 
01:29:30 EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS OF THE BLACK FIRE BRIGADE PARTICULARLY THOSE 
01:29:34 MENTORING THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND PROVIDING CONTINUED AWARENESS AS 
01:29:39 THE FIRE SAFETY AND FIRE PREVENTION. 
01:29:40 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL THAT YOU'RE DOING TO HELP MAKE OUR 
01:29:43 COMMUNITY A BETTER COMMUNITY. 
01:29:46 THANK YOU SO MUCH, MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:29:49 >> GIVEN THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER SPEAKERS, I WANT TO AD MY VOICE. 
01:29:55 AS THE MAYOR OF AN ADMISSION THAT SETTLED THE NEWEST CLASS CASE, AND 
01:30:03 ALSO THE MISREPRESENTATION THAT YOU ARE NOT A GRADUATE OF CHICAGO 
01:30:12 SCHOOLS, WERE OPEN FINALLY. 
01:30:13 THE REASON THAT THIS IS SO IMPORTANT IS WE ALL KNOW THE HISTORY OF 
01:30:17 FIRE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER AGENCIES IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO AND THERE 
01:30:20 IS A NEW DATE COMING TOGETHER. 
01:30:22 AND I DO WANT TO TAKE A PUBLIC NOTE, FOR ALL THE ELDERS THAT LIVED IN 
01:30:28 A TIME WHEN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DID NOT PROTECT THE VALUES, YOU 
01:30:34 DIDN'T JUST TAKE YOUR VICTORY AND TAKE IT HOME. 
01:30:36 YOU KNEW YOU HAD AN OBLIGATION FOR ANOTHER GENERATION NEVER TO GO 
01:30:41 WHERE YOU WENT. 
01:30:42 NOT TO HAVE TO WALK IN THAT HIGH GRASS AND HIGH AREA. 
01:30:49 TO ALL THE STUDENTS THAT ARE HERE, THIS TIME YOU HEAR IT ALL THE 
01:30:53 TIME, BUT THIS TIME, LISTEN TO YOUR ELD IRZ. 
01:30:56 --ELDERS. 
01:30:58 THEY HAVE BLAZED A PATH WHEN OTHERS WOULD NOT LISTEN. 
01:31:06 AND AS ALDERMAN SAWYER SAY, THIS CONTINUES TODAY. 
01:31:08 THEY WERE THERE WHEN THE CITY TURNED ITS BACK AND THEY HAD TO KEEP 
01:31:12 KNOCKING ON THE DOOR. 
01:31:14 KNOW THAT THIS MOMENT IN TIME AS A MENTOR YOU, OPEN YOUR EYES UP TO A 
01:31:22 PROFESSION AND CAREER CALLING TO THOSE THAT WENT BEFORE YOU, THAT 
01:31:27 WASN'T THAT EASY. 
01:31:29 IT WAS REALLY HARD AND IT WAS MENTALLY HARD, BUT BECAUSE THE DOOR DID 
01:31:36 NOT SAY NOT WANTED. 
01:31:38 THE BLACK BRIGADE, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE 
01:31:47 RESPONSIBILITIES WHEN WE HAVE FALLEN SHORT. 
01:31:52 CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS RESOLUTION.

01:42:04 DAYS. 
01:42:07 IT TAKES AN INTENSE AMOUNT OF COURAGE TO STAND ONE ON ONE WITH A GUY. 
01:42:12 AND MOST PEOPLE, THINK THREE MINUTES IS NOTHING. 
01:42:14 IT SEEMS LIKE AN ETERNITY. 
01:42:17 I THINK WHEN WE WERE BOXING WE STARTED AT TWO MINUTE ROUND. 
01:42:22 AND THE GOOD GUYS AT THREE-MINUTE ROUNDS. 
01:42:25 BEST WISHES, MAY GOD BE LOOK AFTER YOU AND MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS

01:44:40 A LOT THAT HAS BEEN SAID IS ABOUT THE TRAINING FOR THE RING.

01:44:46 THE JOURNEY OF BEING RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS. 
01:44:49 AND TO THE REVEREND AND ALL THE OTHER MEMBERS, I WANT TO THANK YOU TO

01:49:06 HE TOOK A LITTLE TINY FIELD HOUSE IN A PARK CALLED COLANIS PARK THAT 
01:49:15 NO LONGER PARK. 
01:49:21 BUT THE COLANIS PARK WAS HALF THE SIZE OF THE ROOM BEHIND COUNCIL 
01:49:26 CHAMBERS, AND YET HE WAS ABLE TO ORGANIZE THESE AMAZING PROGRAMS 
01:49:30 INVOLVING HUNDREDS OF KIDS, INVOLVED IN ORGANIZED SPORTS ACTIVITIES 
01:49:36 AND WINNING CHAMPIONSHIP TEAMS. 
01:49:39 AND REALLY LITERALLY, SAVING LIVES. 
01:49:43 KEEPING KIDS IN PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES AND OFF THE STREETS. 
01:49:47 AND IT WAS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE. 
01:49:49 AND IT WAS THAT EXPERIENCE THAT COLANIS PARK THAT CAUGHT THE 
01:49:56 ATTENTION OF FOREST WHO AT THE TIME BACK IN THE 1980s WAS HEAD OF THE 
01:50:00 PARK DISTRICT. 
01:50:03 AND EVINCED JIM TO LEAVE US TO GO TO GARFIELD PARK ON THE WEST SIDE. 
01:50:09 BUT HE WENT FROM ONE OF THE SMALLEST PARKS IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO 
01:50:15 PARK SYSTEM TO ONE OF THE LARGEST AND TOOK ALL THE SUCCESSFUL THINGS 
01:50:20 HE DID THEM THERE AND MULTIPLIED THEM BY 100-FOLD. 
01:50:26 JIM IS A FRIEND, HE HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTELY INTEGRAL PART OF THE 
01:50:32 ROGER'S PARK COMMUNITY AND THE CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT. 
01:50:35 AND I WISH HIM VERY WELL IN HIS RETIREMENT. 
01:50:40 [APPLAUSE] 
01:50:46 >> CONGRATULATIONS. 
01:50:51 OH ALDERMAN ERVIN. 
01:50:53 >> THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT. 
01:50:56 THE WEST SIDE WAS A VERY FORTUNATE RECIPIENT OF JIM. 
01:51:06 HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY WEST SIDE BASKETBALL PLAYER MAKE ITING 
01:51:10 BIFMGT HE WAS THE ONE THAT OPENED THE GYM TO NUMEROUS YOUNG PEOPLE 
01:51:14 AND THE PASSION THAT HE HAS MORE YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. 
01:51:27 WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO REMRAI.S SOMEBODY WHO HAS PROVIDED LOVE TO 
01:51:34 THOSE WHO NEEDED LOVE AND HUGS TO THOSE WHO NEEDED HUGS. 
01:51:39 AND ALWAYS HAD HOT DOGS AVAILABLE THAT DREW PEOPLE THERE FOR THE FOOD 
01:51:46 THAN THE BASKETBALL. 
01:51:48 A LOST YOUNG PEOPLE OWE A DEBT TO MR. HOPSON. 
01:51:58 HE IS SAVED COUNTLESS LIVES. 
01:51:59 SO THE WORK THAT HE'S DONE THROUGHOUT HIS TENURE WITH THE CHICAGO 
01:52:05 PARK DISTRICT AND ON THE WEST SIDE OF CHICAGO, IS SOMETHING THAT I 
01:52:10 AND THE RESIDENT OF 28th WARD ARE GRATEFUL FOR HIS TIME AND 
01:52:15 COMMITMENT AND ALWAYS WANTING TO GET THE JOB DONE. 
01:52:18 JIM, THANK YOU AND I TRULY APPRECIATE YOUR SERVICE. 
01:52:21 I WANT TO SAY THIS ON BAF OF ED SMITH, WHEN YOU CAME, HE WAS THE 
01:52:25 ALDERMAN. 
01:52:26 HE ALWAYS SPOKE. 
01:52:29 HE SAID NEVER LET JIM GO, BUT I GUESS YOU GOT A CHANCE TO SIGN THOSE 
01:52:34 PAPERS BEFORE I GOT TO YOU. 
01:52:36 CONGRATULATIONS.

01:58:24 CONSTENI CARRIGAN. 
01:58:26 ONE GOES TO UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:58:29 AND KIE RA IS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO WOOD LAWN CAMPUS. 
01:58:34 [APPLAUSE] 
01:58:39 THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. 
01:58:40 >> THANK YOU, WELCOME TO THE CHICAGO COUNCIL MEETING. 
01:58:44 COMMITTEE REPORTS, FINANCE, CHAIRMAN BURKE. 
01:58:47 >> ARE 
01:58:57 >> ACCORDING TO THE CITY AND FINANCE, THE COMMITTEE ON ADDENDUM HAS 
01:59:10 TWO MATTERS ATTENDING. 
01:59:14 THE FIRST ONE REQUESTING INFORMATION AND CITY AGENCIES ON THE 
01:59:23 SEPARATION POLICY AND A SECOND MATTER TO AD CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES TO 
01:59:32 THE INSTITUTIONS, PLACES. 
01:59:38 AND FACILITIES INQUIRING LICENSES IN THESE FACILITIES. 
01:59:45 I HAVE A SUBSTITUTE I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER. 
01:59:48 MEMBERS SHOULD HAVE IT ON YOUR DESK, SIGNED BY ALDERMAN SOLIS AND I. 
02:00:01 THE PARING THAT WAS CONDUCTED WAS QUITE INTERESTING AND IT COULD BE 
02:00:06 THAT SOME MEMBERS WANT TO COMMENT, I THINK ALDERMAN MALDONADO HAD 
02:00:13 SOME OBSERVATIONS. 
02:00:17 >> ALDERMAN MALDONADO. 
02:00:20 >> THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. 
02:00:25 AGAIN, I AM IN THE SUPPORT OF ALDERMAN BURKE'S EFFORTS. 
02:00:35 I SAID IN THAT HEARING, FEW DAYS AGO, AND I WAS PERPLEXED IN THE WAY 
02:00:48 THAT ALDERMAN SOLIS AND ALDERMAN BURKE DID ASK OF HIM. 
02:00:53 I WAS, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY WERE ATTEMPTING TO HIDE ACTIVITIES 
02:01:01 FROM THE BODY. 
02:01:04 AND IT DIDN'T HIT ME UNTIL, AND IT DIDN'T LEAVE ME WITH A GOOD TASTE 
02:01:10 IN YOUR MOUTH. 
02:01:14 AND SO, AND I FELT, IMPOTENT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY OVERSIGHT. 
02:01:21 WE DON'T HAVE ANY OVERSIGHT WITH EVERY ENDEAVOUR THAT OCCUR IN THE 
02:01:30 CITY OF CHICAGO WITH RESPECT TO ORGANIZATION WITH RESPECT TO 
02:01:34 BUSINESSES, BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND LICENSE AND ACTIVITIES AND WE HAVE 
02:01:40 OVERSIGHT OBLIGATION OVER THERE. 
02:01:42 IN THE CASE OF APARTMENT THAT HAVE HOUSED, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS 
02:01:49 HAPPENED TO MANY OF THOSE CHILDREN THAT HAVE COME FROM OVER THE 
02:01:51 BORDER. 
02:01:54 WE CANNOT GET ANY STRAIGHT ANSWERS. 
02:02:01 FROM HARDING ALLIANCE AND THEY EVEN CAME ACROSS SOMEWHAT ARROGANT 
02:02:07 WHEN THEY WERE DESCRIBING THEIR POSITION THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO 
02:02:12 REVEAL ANY INFORMATION TO US. 
02:02:14 AND THEY WERE HIDING BEHIND ORR, AND THEY CANNOT TELL US WHO IS 
02:02:21 FUNDING THEIR ACTIVITIES. 
02:02:23 ORR OR WHO? 
02:02:27 BUT YET THEY GET ABOUT 10 TO 12 MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE CITY OF 
02:02:31 CHICAGO AND WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THEM. 
02:02:34 I THINK THIS IS AN ACTION BY DETERMINE OF FINEST COMMUNITY AND 
02:02:41 ALDERMAN SOLIS, THAT YOU KEEP PUSHING FOR THIS, AT THAT POINT WHERE 
02:02:46 WE CAN LICENSE. 
02:02:50 THIS SEPARATIONS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE OVERSIGHT OBLIGATIONS UPON THEM 
02:02:57 AND THAT THEY CAN EITHER AND THAT THEY CAN, THEY CAN COME AND TAKE 
02:03:03 THE PORTION. 
02:03:04 THANK YOU. 
02:03:05 >> ALDERMAN SOLIS. 
02:03:06 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:03:07 I JUST WANT TO BRING BACK, THE ISSUE OR THE REASON WHY, THIS 
02:03:16 ORDINANCE WAS PUT TOGETHER AND WHY WE HAD A HEARING LAST WEEK, WITH 
02:03:22 PRESIDENT, YOU AND I SPONSORED HARD AND ALLIANCE TO COME TO TESTIFY. 
02:03:29 AND THAT REASON WAS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. 
02:03:32 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT X-NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT 
02:03:37 THAT NUMBER IS, WHETHER IT'S 66 OR 73. 
02:03:42 AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT AGES, WHETHER THEY'RE INFANTS OR YOUNGER 
02:03:50 OLDER, CHILDREN. 
02:03:52 BUT IF YOU STOP AND THINK ABOUT THE ISSUE, AND STOP TO THINK ABOUT 
02:03:58 YOUR PARENTS THAT ARE STILL AT THE BORDER, MAYBE STILL BEING HELD WHO 
02:04:03 WERE SEPARATED FROM THEIR KIDS ANYWHERE FROM A MONTH OR TWO MONTHS 
02:04:08 NOW, AND THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE KIDS ARE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE 
02:04:11 COUNTRY. 
02:04:14 AND I KNOW THAT IF THEY'RE IN CHICAGO AND THEY KNOW THAT THERE IS 
02:04:21 MUNICIPAL AUTHORITY, US, ELECTED OFFICIALS, SOME OF US ALSO BEING 
02:04:24 LATINO AND MEXICAN LIKE THEY ARE, LATIN AMERICAN FROM HONDURAS, 
02:04:36 GUATEMALA, ET CETERA, THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER 
02:04:39 ORGANIZATION IS TAKING CARE OF THEIR KIDS THAT THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF 
02:04:42 THEIR KIDS. 
02:04:44 SXL THAT'S SIMPLY, THE MAIN ISSUE THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED HERE. 
02:04:54 NOW, I'M NOT BLAMING HARDING ALLIANCE FOR WHAT THEIR ADMINISTRATION 
02:04:59 DID WITH THE ZERO TOLERANCE. 
02:05:02 BUT THEY COULD HAVE ACTED SOONER. 
02:05:04 THE INFORMATION THAT WAS GIVEN AT THE COMMITTEE MEETING THIS WEEK, 
02:05:08 COULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN LAST MONTH IN JUNE WHEN ALL OF THIS ISSUE WAS 
02:05:15 BEING EXPOSED WHEN THIS ATROCITY WAS BEING EX POEDS. 
02:05:19 I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO PASS IS A SUBSTITUTE. 
02:05:26 BUT IT BASICALLY IDENTIFIES THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO INSPECTIONS, AND 
02:05:29 THAT'S A GOOD THING TO DO. TO FIND OUT IF THE FACILITIES THAT ARE 
02:05:33 TAKING CARE OF THESE KIDS ARE ADEQUATE ENOUGH TO BE SAFE. 
02:05:36 WE'RE GOING TO IDENTIFY HOW MANY KIDS, WHAT AGES THEY ARE AND WE'RE 
02:05:41 GOING TO IDENTIFY WHERE THESE FACILITIES THEY ARE. 
02:05:44 THERE WILL NOT BE THIS MYSTERY BECAUSE OF OH WE CANNOT GIVE 
02:05:49 INFORMATION, BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS PROHIBITING US FROM 
02:05:52 DOING THAT. 
02:05:54 WE'RE TAKING MATTERS INTO OUR OWN HAND. 
02:05:56 AND MR. PRESIDENT, YOU SAID IT MANY TIMES, SOMETIMES THE FEDERAL 
02:06:00 GOVERNMENT, MANY TIMES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, SOMETIMES THE STATE OF 
02:06:03 ILLINOIS DON'T DO THE JOB THAT THEY NEED TO DO. 
02:06:07 AND IT FALLS ON OUR SHOULDERS, OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT 
02:06:11 NOT ONLY CITIZENS BUT ESPECIALLY CHILDREN THAT ARE BEING HOUSED IN 
02:06:16 THE CITY OF CHICAGO, THEY'RE GOING TO BE TAING CARE OF AND WE'RE 
02:06:19 GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE THAT THEY GET TAKEN CARE OF. 
02:06:22 THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:06:24 >> ALDERMAN JOE MOORE? 
02:06:26 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:06:28 LET ME START OFF BY FIRST SAYING THAT I'M GOING TO VOTE IN FAVOR THE 
02:06:39 THE SUBSTITUTE, NOT BECAUSE I'M THRILLED WITH IT BUT BECAUSE POLITICS 
02:06:45 IS COMPROMISED AND FAR BETTER THAN WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY WAS PROPOSED. 
02:06:51 LET ME PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT, SOME OF THE FACILITIES THAT HARING IS IN 
02:06:59 MY WARD. 
02:07:02 IT'S BEEN IN MY WARD LONG BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUMP STARTED SEPARATING 
02:07:11 CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS. 
02:07:12 I THINK WE ALL AGREE IN THE CITY COUNCIL THAT WHAT THIS PRESIDENT AND 
02:07:18 HIS ADMINISTRATION HAVE DONE, IS ABSOLUTELY CONTRARY TO OUR VALUES, 
02:07:25 IT'S REPREHENSIBLE. 
02:07:28 IT IS AN UTTER SHAME. 
02:07:32 HART LAND HAS BEEN HOUSING YOUNG UNDOCUMENTED, UNACCOMPANIED MINORS 
02:07:39 FOR, I WOULD GUESS AT LEAST 15-18 YEARS, I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE BUT 
02:07:45 THEY'VE BEEN DOING THAT A LONG TIME. 
02:07:48 BEFORE THEY DID THAT, THOSE CHILDREN WHO CAME ACROSS OUR BORDER 
02:07:53 WITHOUT PARENTS, AND WERE PICKED UP BY IMMIGRATION AUTHORIZATION, 
02:07:58 WERE LITERALLY PUT IN JAILS. 
02:08:02 THEY WERE JAILED WITH ADULTS. 
02:08:16 THAT WAS UNCONTIONABLE THING TO DO. 
02:08:18 SO THEY PUT THEM IN AREAS THAT WERE MORE HUMANE, MUCH LIKE SCHOOL 
02:08:25 DORMITORIES THAN JAILS, WHILE WE FIGURED OUT WHO THESE CHILDREN WERE 
02:08:29 AND MADE SURE THEY WERE RETURNED SAFELY TO THE ARMS OF THEIR PARENTS. 
02:08:35 THEY'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. 
02:08:38 NOBODY HERE CALLED FOR INSPECTION OR ACCOUNTING, WE KNEW THEY WERE 
02:08:41 THERE. 
02:08:43 WE KNEW THEY WERE DOING THIS. 
02:08:45 BUT IT WAS ONLY UNTIL THERE WAS A NEWS MEDIA REPORT IN "WASHINGTON 
02:08:51 POST" WHICH ALLEGED THAT HERE IN CHICAGO, SOME OF THE RESENT 
02:08:58 IMMIGRANTS, THOSE CHILDREN THAT WERE SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS 
02:09:01 WERE MISTREATED. 
02:09:03 THOSE WERE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS. 
02:09:05 THOSE ARE ALLEGATIONS THAT NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED. 
02:09:09 BUT THEY'RE ONLY ALLEGATIONS. 
02:09:11 HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE BEEN A VICTIM OF MISINFORMATION IN A NEWS 
02:09:15 MEDIA? 
02:09:22 RATHER THAN RUSH INTO A SOLVING A PROBLEM THAT MAY OR MAY NOT EXIST, 
02:09:26 WHY DON'T WE SEE IF THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE AT A MINIMUM. 
02:09:30 AND THEN, IF THEY HAPPEN TO BE TRUE, LET'S THOUGHTFULLY PUT INTO 
02:09:42 PLACE, A REGULATORY SCHEME THAT IS BOTH THOROUGH AS WELL AS 
02:09:50 COGNIZANT OF THE TAXPAYER DOLLAR. 
02:09:56 THIS SCHEME THAT WE'RE VOTING ON TODAY IS GOING TO COST THE CITY 
02:09:58 MONEY. 
02:10:00 WHY DON'T WE FIRST FIND OUT IF WE HAVE A PROBLEM BEFORE WE TRY TO 
02:10:03 SOLVE IT. 
02:10:05 AS I SAID, I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS SUBSTITUTE BECAUSE IT 
02:10:11 REPRESENTS A BETTER VERSION THAN WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED BUT I 
02:10:17 DO SO VERY RELUCTANTLY. 
02:10:18 THANK YOU. 
02:10:19 >> ALDERMAN BURKE. 
02:10:24 >> MR. PRESIDENT, I THINK HEARING WHAT FROM THE FINANCES IS QUITE 
02:10:33 INFORMATIVE. 
02:10:35 PRIOR TO THE FIRE THAT ALDERMAN SOLIS AND I RAISED THIS ISSUE, THE 
02:10:47 AGENCY FOR THE GOVERNMENT WAS BEST TO GUARANTEE THESE KIDS ARE GOING 
02:10:53 TO BE IN A SAFE SETH. 
02:10:56 WE DID NOT EVEN KNOW THE ADDRESS OF WHERE THEY WERE HOUSED. 
02:11:04 I DIDN'T KNOW THAT AND I'M SURE MOST OF YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT THIS 
02:11:13 SUBSIDIARY OF HARTLAND IS TAKING IN 50 MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT WE 
02:11:21 ONLY DISCOVERED BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO REVIEW THE 990s THAT ARE 
02:11:27 FILED WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
02:11:29 AND THAT'S TWO YEARS AGO. 
02:11:30 I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THEY'RE COLLECTING NOW. 
02:11:42 BECAUSE NOUZ SINCE THAT 990 FILED IN 2016, THEY'RE TAKING IN INFANTS. 
02:11:49 ONE WOULD HAVE TO ASK THEMSELVES, DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO BRING A BABY 
02:11:55 FROM A THOUSAND MILES AWAY TO CHICAGO. 
02:11:59 I DON'T THINK ANY OF US DO, UP UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN THE STORY 
02:12:05 WAS PUBLISHED IN THE "WASHINGTON POST" THAT MAYBE 77 KIDS ARE HERE IN 
02:12:09 CHICAGO. 
02:12:11 AND WE LEARNED FROM A TESTIMONY OF A BOY IN THE SUBSIDIARY THAT THEY 
02:12:20 WERE BROUGHT TO THEIR DOORSTEP BY AN ARMED ICE AGENT. 
02:12:25 A LITTLE BABY, IN DIAPERS. 
02:12:34 BEING BROUGHT TO THIS AGENCY BY ICE AGENT? 
02:12:38 WHAT ARE THEY AFRAID OF? 
02:12:40 AND OF COURSE I DIDN'T KNOW, PERHAPS MOST OF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE 
02:12:52 PRESIDENT OF HARTLAND HAD ENTERED INTO A AGREEMENT WITH THE BOARD OF 
02:13:02 ETHICS AND PAID A 50,000 FINE AFTER THE PRESIDENT ADMITTED THAT SHE 
02:13:16 NEGOTIATED HER SALARY AND GOT CONDITION WHILE SHE WAS THE 
02:13:22 COMMISSIONER OF DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES. 
02:13:33 $361,000 A YEAR. 
02:13:35 THAT WAS TWO YEARS AGO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SALARY IS NOW. 
02:13:45 THE AMOUNT IS REFLECTED IN 2016. 
02:13:48 BUT SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE. 
02:13:53 THE GENTLEMAN THAT TESTIFIED HERE, WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF 
02:14:01 THE SUBSIDIARY THAT IS TAKING IN $50 MILLION AT LEAST IN 2016, HIS 
02:14:08 SALARY IS $23 2000. 
02:14:10 NOW THERE IS A WHOLE LIST OF THESE EXECUTIVES, $232,000, 19 3000, 24 
02:14:22 3000. 
02:14:23 SO WHEN YOU PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE, YOU KNOW WHAT THE SALARY OF 
02:14:31 SAOUMENT OF POLICE IN CHICAGO, $202,00. 
02:14:42 THE SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE IS 260,000. 
02:14:49 NOW THE PRESIDENT WHO NEGOTIATED THIS AGREEMENT WITH THE BOARD OF 
02:14:54 ETHICS AND IT'S ALSO INTERESTING TO READ THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. 
02:15:04 NOT A SINGLE (INAUDIBLE). 
02:15:07 IT REFERS TO THE SSO, WHICH I GUESS MEANS SOCIAL SERVICE ORGANIZATION. 
02:15:16 SO ALDERMAN DOWELL ALSO HAD SOME QUESTIONS AT THE HEARING. 
02:15:25 SHE TOLD US HOW SHE HAS ONE OF THESE FACILITIES IN HER WARD. 
02:15:32 TWO WEEKS AGO, SHE WAS THERE TRYING TO WELCOME THE ORGANIZATION TO 
02:15:41 HER NEIGHBORHOOD. 
02:15:43 THEY TURNED HER AWAY. 
02:15:48 THE ALDERMAN CAN'T GET IN ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY BECAUSE SOMEBODY 
02:15:52 AT THE OFFICE RESELTDMENT TOLD HARTLAND THEY COULD NOT ALLOW THE 
02:16:05 ALDERMAN IN. 
02:16:08 WELL I'VE LEARNED TODAY, STARTED ASKING SOME QUESTIONS, THE CARDINAL 
02:16:19 ARCHBISHOP OF CHICAGO, HAS BEEN ADMITTED TO TAKE A TOUR OR VISIT 
02:16:23 TODAY. 
02:16:26 YOU KNOW, THAT HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET PERMISSION FOR FOUR WEEKS. 
02:16:37 ON JUNE 25th, HE ASKED FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT, ONE WOULD THINK, 
02:16:44 AS A PRINCE OF THE CHURCH, CARDINAL ARCHBISHOP, HE WOULD BE SOMEBODY 
02:16:53 THAT WOULD BE GRANTED APPROVAL. 
02:17:00 SO, ALDERMAN DOWELL, DON'T FEEL TOO BAD, IF THE CARDINAL CAN'T GET IN 
02:17:05 FOR FOUR WEEKS, BE PATIENT. 
02:17:07 BUT BY THE WAY, HIS STAFF HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED FOR A VISIT. 
02:17:19 THIS APPARENTLY IS SAME OFFICIAL FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHO WILL 
02:17:28 NOT ALLOW HARTLAND TO TELL THIS BODY HOW MANY, HOW MANY OF THESE 
02:17:34 CHILDREN ARE YOU HOUSING? 
02:17:37 OH NO NO NO NO, WE CAN'T TELL YOU THAT. 
02:17:40 WELL, WHY NOT? 
02:17:49 TAKE CHEESE CHILDREN, GIVING THEM OVER TO A ICE AGENT WHO THEN 
02:17:54 DELIVERS THEM TO HARTLAND, HAS TO RAISE SOME QUESTIONS. 
02:18:02 IF NOT JUST COMMON SENSE QUESTIONS, WHAT IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
02:18:07 DOING HERE? 
02:18:12 THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS WHICH IS WHY IN ALL, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, YOUR 
02:18:16 HONOR. 
02:18:19 THAT'S WHY ALDERMAN SOLIS AND I ORIGINALLY BROUGHT THIS OUT THE 
02:18:26 HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT LOOK AT THESE PLACES TO 
02:18:32 SEE IF THERE IS SMOKE IN THERE. 
02:18:34 TO SEE IF THERE IS CO-2 DETECTED. 
02:18:38 TO SEE IF THE FOOD SERVICE IS UP-TO-DATE IN A WAY THAT COMPLIES WITH 
02:18:44 THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. 
02:18:50 FINALLY, LAST WEEK, A TASK FORCE OF CITY INVESTIGATORS INSPECTED 
02:18:56 THESE FIVE LOCATIONS, PERHAPS THAT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. 
02:19:00 ONE WOULD THINK THAT NUMBER ONE, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OUGHT TO 
02:19:07 STOP THIS. 
02:19:12 THIS CRUEL, IT IS INHUMAN. 
02:19:18 IT IS, SENSELESS, TO MOVE THESE INFANTS A THOUSAND MILES FROM THEIR 
02:19:25 THEY'RE TAKEN TO HERE IN CHICAGO, UNLESS THERE IS SOME REAL REASON. 
02:19:34 I'M SURE THIS IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY, YOUR HONOR. 
02:19:38 HOPEFULLY, THIS IS A WAKE UP CALL. 
02:19:48 THE BUILDING COMMISSIONER AND REVIEWING THE FACILITIES ALONG WITH THE 
02:19:53 FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT DID NOT NOTICE ANY SERIOUS 
02:20:00 QUESTIONS BUT IT'S STRANGE THAT THE FACILITY SHE WENT TO, DIDN'T HAVE 
02:20:04 ANY BABIES. 
02:20:06 I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY HAVE THE BABIES. 
02:20:09 BUT IF YOU LISTEN TO HER TESTIMONY, SHE ONLY TWO TEENAGE KIDS. 
02:20:15 AT ANY RATE, I THINK IT'S A WAKE UP CALL THAT DOES NOT--THERE IS NOT 
02:20:22 A LOT WE CAN DO TO STOP THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM THIS TRAVESTY BUT 
02:20:29 I THINK, WE CAN INFLUENCE THE AGENCIES AND THE PARTNERS WITH THE FEDS 
02:20:35 IN THIS PROCESS. 
02:20:40 SO, YOUR HONOR, I'M RELUCTANT AS ALDERMAN MOORE IS TO VOTE FOR THIS, 
02:20:46 BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT GOES IN. 
02:20:49 BUT IN THE INTERIM WHILE WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT IT, I WOULD MOVE THAT 
02:20:58 THE SUBSTITUTE BE ADOPTED IN THE HONOR OF THIS. 
02:21:04 >> ALDERMAN PI LAR, WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS? 
02:21:08 >> AND ?OU WE'LL GO BACK TO YOUR MOTION, CHAIRMAN. 
02:21:11 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:21:15 YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A HEADLINE THAT SAID AGENCY THAT CONTRACTS WITH 
02:21:21 TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 
02:21:27 LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK AND REALIZE THAT HARTLAND LIVES DOES AND THE 
02:21:37 KIND OF SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE. 
02:21:39 BEFORE I GO THERE BESINGER IF THERE WAS WRONGDOING, WHERE THE 
02:21:43 CHILDREN WERE HOUSED, THAT SHOULD BE FIXED. 
02:21:46 IF YOU WANT BETTER RESULTS FROM SOCIAL SERVICES, FUND THEM. 
02:21:55 IF THERE WERE PEOPLE OR STAFF THAT COMMITTED A CRIME, THEY SHOULD BE 
02:21:59 CHARGED. 
02:22:01 BUT THE IDEA THAT EVELYN DIAZ OR DAVID OR OTHER SENIOR STAFF OF 
02:22:10 HARTLAND LAOKTD OTHER WAY OR THAT THEY CUT A DEAL WITH THE TRUMP 
02:22:15 ADMINISTRATION IS JUST NOT TRUE. 
02:22:17 THESE CHILDREN SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES. 
02:22:20 THEY SHOULD NOT BE IN CHICAGO, THEY SHOULD BE WITH THEIR PARENTS. 
02:22:23 BUT THEY'RE HERE. 
02:22:30 AND ANY AGENCY SHOULD BE TAKING CARE OF THEM IS HARTLAND ALLIANCE. 
02:22:37 SO WHEN I HEAR DIAZ SALARY AND DAVID, THEY'RE UNDERPAID BECAUSE WE 
02:22:46 LEVEL, AND MANY WAYS DES TROIT SOCIAL SERVICES SERVICES SUCH AS I 
02:22:52 KNOW THAT THE OFFICE OF REFUGEE WHERE I WAS AN INTERN, IS ON ITS LAST 
02:22:59 LEGS BAUTZ TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS CUT REFUGEE RESETLEMENT. 
02:23:04 NOW WE HAVE ALL OF THESE REFUGEES HERE THAT WE HAVE TO SERVE AND CAME 
02:23:10 HERE ESCAPING POVERTY AND TERROR AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO 
02:23:13 PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. 
02:23:14 NUMBER ONE. 
02:23:19 NUMBER TWO, HARTLAND ALLIANCE GETS 1500 PER PERSON FROM THE 
02:23:25 DEPARTMENT OF STATE. 
02:23:28 $1500 SO FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR, IT'S $6,000 BUCKS TO FIND THEM 
02:23:35 HOUSING, TO GET THEM ACCESS TO MASS TRANSIT, TO GET THEM SIGNED UP 
02:23:40 FOR PUBLIC AID. 
02:23:41 THEY GIVE THEM THE BASIC NECESSITIES SO THEY CAN START A LIFE HERE IN 
02:23:45 THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
02:23:46 AND THE IDEA THAT WE'RE NOW, HOLDING THEM UP AS AND COMPLAINING THEM 
02:23:57 WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS JUST WRONG. 
02:24:01 AGAIN IF SOMETHING HAPPENED THERE AND SOME OF THE STAFF IF THEY WERE 
02:24:06 ABUSED AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A INSPECTION, LET'S DO THAT. 
02:24:12 BUT DON'T DEMONIZED THE AGENCY THAT GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY LEANS ON 
02:24:17 BECAUSE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT DO ITS DAM JOB. 
02:24:20 I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE LAST THING, THE CITY OF CHICAGO TOOK IN 10,000 
02:24:29 PEOPLE, 10,000 EVACUEES AFTER HURRICANE CATRINA. 
02:24:33 NOT ONE WENT HOME. 
02:24:38 IN FACT, MANY PEOPLE RECOVERED WHETHER YOU'RE ABLE TO START AND BE A 
02:24:44 IN A BETTER PLACE. 
02:24:45 AND YOU KNOW WHO IS IN THE LEAD? 
02:24:49 HARTLAND ALLIANCE. 
02:24:50 THEY LEAD THE EFFORT. 
02:24:58 WE WANT TO FIX A PROBLEM WITH THE FACILITY FIX. 
02:25:03 THE KIDS SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN SEPARATED. 
02:25:06 THE ADMINISTRATION IS DISGUSTING. 
02:25:08 THE PRESIDENT IS A BAD PERSON. 
02:25:10 THE ACTIONS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION IS, THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE 
02:25:14 SEPARATING FAMILIES. 
02:25:15 AND IF WE'RE GOING TO BRING NEM ANYBODISINGER I WANT THEM ALT HA*RT 
02:25:24 LAND ALLIANCE WHILE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DOING THEIR JOB IN 
02:25:27 REUNITING PEOPLE. 
02:25:28 I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY, OTHER THAN, WHERE ARE WE AS A COUNTRY 
02:25:39 WHERE WE CAN,--(INAUDIBLE) SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. 
02:25:42 THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:25:43 [APPLAUSE]. 
02:25:47 >> MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU WANT TO MOVE YOUR MOTION? 
02:25:51 ROLL CALL? 
02:25:52 OKAY. 
02:25:56 HEARING NO OBJECTION, SO ORDERED. 
02:25:58 I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK FOR ONE SECOND ON THIS. 
02:26:06 I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I THINK THAT THE CITY OF CHICAGO STEP 
02:26:11 FORWARD IN A APPROPRIATE WAY. 
02:26:13 BAUTZ FACT OF A MATTER IS FOR A LONG TIME, NO PRESIDENT OF EITHER 
02:26:19 PARTY EVERY EMBARKED OR ACTIVATED WHAT IS CALLED A ZERO TOLERANCE 
02:26:25 LIKE DONALD TRUMP BROUGHT ABOUT. 
02:26:27 SEPARATING THEIR PARENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN. 
02:26:29 NOW WE'RE DISCOVERING PARENTS ARE SENT BACK WITH THEIR KIDS. 
02:26:33 WE WOULD NOT IN A SITUATION. 
02:26:35 , IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A PRESIDENT IN THE ADMINISTRATION THAT WENT TO A 
02:26:41 PLACE WHERE NO OTHER PRESIDENT HAS GONE. 
02:26:43 THE SECOND, THE TRUTH OF THIS MATTER WHEN IT COMES TO REGULATORY 
02:26:47 OVERSIGHT, IT'S THE STATE OF ILLINOIS THAT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY AND 
02:26:49 WE ALL KNOW THAT WHEN IT COMES TO DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY 
02:26:55 SEFSHSZ, NOT ONE WOULD WANT A IDENTIFIED WHERE A CHILD IS. 
02:27:01 AND WHETHER IT TOOK THIS, I THINK THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE STEP TO 
02:27:06 ENSURE THAT WHILE CHILDREN ARE HERE, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 
02:27:12 FACILITIES THAT THEY'RE HOUSED AT, REACH ALL THE STANDARDS THAT WE AS 
02:27:16 A CITY OF CHICAGO EXPECT. 
02:27:18 BUT I WOULD LIKE US TO REMEMBER, WE'RE STEPPING INTO A VOID, BECAUSE 
02:27:24 OF A CHANGE OS THAT WAS CREATED UNNECESSARILY BY AN ADMINISTRATION 
02:27:29 AND ALSO UNNECESSARY BY A STATE AGENCY THAT DOES NOT DO ITS JOB. 
02:27:33 CHAIRMAN BURKE.

03:11:34 ~>> ALDERMAN KING. 
03:11:36 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
03:11:39 I BELIEVE MY COSPONSOR ALDERMAN REILEY STEPPED OUT BY I WANT TO THANK 
03:11:48 YOU CHAIRMAN FOR BRINGING THIS TO A VOTE FOR TO THE AGENDA. 
03:11:56 IDA B WELLS WAS YOU KNOW, A PHENOMENAL WOMEN, I SAID EARLIER TODAY. 
03:12:01 SHE WAS KIND OF LIKE THE ORIGINAL BOSS. 
03:12:09 SHE DID THINGS WHEN HER LIFE WAS LITERALLY AT A RISK WHERE SHE WAS AT 
03:12:12 RISK OF LOSING HER LIFE. 
03:12:17 THIS MOMENT TODAY, IS A HISTORICAL MOMENT. 
03:12:22 A BIRTH DATE SWEET MOMENT BECAUSE IT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THERE HAS 
03:12:29 NEVER BEEN A STREET DOWNTOWN NAMED AFTER A WOMAN AND/OR A PERSON OF 
03:12:34 COLOR. 
03:12:37 AND SO IT'S LONG OVERDUE. 
03:12:40 BUT CERTAINLY, SOMEBODY LIKE IDA B.WELLS AND HER LEGACY IS AN 
03:12:49 APPROPRIATE NAME TO HAVE AS THE FIRST WOMEN AND/OR PERSON OF COLOR IN 
03:12:56 THE DOWNTOWN AREA OF CHICAGO. 
03:12:58 I'VE BEEN PEOPLE CALL ME THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AND THEY'RE TRYING 
03:13:03 TO FIGURE OUT IF IT MAY EVEN BE THE FIRST PERSON OF COLOR AND PERHAPS 
03:13:09 WOMEN DOWNTOWN. 
03:13:11 SO I CHALLENGE PEOPLE TO SEE THAT. 
03:13:14 SO I APPLAUD THE CITY COUNCIL BECAUSE I BELIEVE ALMOST EVERY SINGLE 
03:13:19 PERSON SIGNED ON TO THIS ORDINANCE IF I'M NOT INCORRECT. 
03:13:23 ALL OF US. 
03:13:24 I APPRECIATE THAT SUPPORT. 
03:13:26 JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS OF NOTE THAT IDA B. WELLS DID. 
03:13:33 BECAUSE THE MORE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THIS, THE MORE I FOUND OUT 
03:13:38 HOW PHENOMENAL SHE WAS. 
03:13:41 HER GREAT GRANDKIDS WERE HERE EARLIER TODAY AT A PRESS CONFERENCE. 
03:13:47 BUT, A COME OF OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT IDA 
03:13:51 B.WELLS AND I WILL NOT BE LABOR THIS, SHE WAS A HUGE PART OF THE 
03:14:02 SUFFERAGE MOVEMENT FOR WOMEN IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO AND IN THE NATION. 
03:14:09 THE STAIFT ILLINOIS, WOMEN GOT RIGHT TO VOTE ALMOST TEN YEARS BEFORE 
03:14:16 THE 19th AMENDMENT WAS PASSED AND SHE WAS A HUGE PART OF THAT. 
03:14:21 DURING THE MARCH IN WASHINGTON WHEN THE SUFFERAGE MOVEMENT MARCHED ON 
03:14:25 WASHINGTON. 
03:14:30 IDA B WELLS REFUSE TODAY MARCH IN THE BACK WHERE THEY DELEGATED THE 
03:14:36 PEOPLE OF COLOR TO MARCH TO. 
03:14:38 AND RAN IN THE FRONT AND MARCH WITH THE WOMEN'SED DELEGATION. 
03:14:41 THAT'S THE TYPE OF WOMEN SHE REPRESENTS. 
03:14:45 BUT WHAT THAT REPRESENTED TO US HERE AND THE CITY OF CHICAGO IS, 
03:14:49 AFTER WOMEN GOT THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE EARLY, IT CHANGED THE FACE OF 
03:14:54 CITY COUNCIL OF CHICAGO. 
03:14:58 IT DIVERSIFIED OF CHICAGO. 
03:15:00 WE THEN GOT OUR FIRST PERSON OF COLOR IN THE CITY COUNCIL. 
03:15:03 IT TOOK A LITTLE LONGER TO GET THE FIRST WOMEN BUT YOU KNOW, LITTLE, 
03:15:10 LARGE THINGS THAT SHE PUT HER LIFE ON THE LIMB PHOBSINGER WE STAND ON 
03:15:18 HER SHOULDER. 
03:15:21 AND THE ANTI SHIFTING MOVEMENT SHE SHIFTED THE PARADIGM WHERE 
03:15:36 LYNCHING WAS NOT A THING. 
03:15:40 PEOPLE WERE LYNCHING UNDER THE LIVES OF BLACK MEN, SUPPOSEDLY RAPING 
03:15:48 WHITE MEN. 
03:15:56 SHE SHIFTED THAT PARADIGM SAYING THAT WAS NOT HAPPENING, WHEN THEY 
03:16:01 WERE USING LYNCHING AS A TOOL TO GET PROPERTY WHEN THEY WERE A 
03:16:06 BEAUCING WOMEN. 
03:16:07 SHE BROUGHT LIGHT TO THAT AND HAD TO FLEE TENNESSEE AND THEN THAT 
03:16:12 BROUGHT HER TO CHICAGO. 
03:16:14 AND THEN IN CHICAGO, SHE STOOD WITH FREDERICK DOUGLAS, REALLY HANDING 
03:16:23 OUT PAMPHLETS ON ANTI LYNCHING, THEN WENT TO EUROPE AND SPREAD THE 
03:16:27 WORD IN EUROPE AND WAS A VERY POPULAR WAMBACH THEN. 
03:16:32 SO I AM HONORED TO BE ABLE TO PLAY A SMALL PART TO HAVE HER LEGACY 
03:16:39 LIFTED UP IN A WAY THAT IT DESERVES. 
03:16:42 I WANT TO THINK ALDERMAN REILLY AND I KNOW HE WANTS TO SAY A FEW 
03:16:48 WORDS. 
03:16:51 BUT THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING HER PLACE IN HISTORY FOR 
03:16:55 UNDERSTANDING, THE IMPORTANCE OF IT AND FOR HELPING TO SHEPHERD THIS 
03:17:01 DAY INTO FRUITION. 
03:17:02 SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. 
03:17:05 AND JUST SAY, THAT YOU KNOW, I'M PROUD TODAY TO HAVE PLAYED A SMALL 
03:17:11 PART IN HAVING A STREET DOWNTOWN NAMED AFTER A WONDERFUL WOMAN WHO'S 
03:17:19 LEGACY IS SO DEEP. 
03:17:20 IF YOU GET A CHANCE READ A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HER AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND 
03:17:24 WHY THIS STREET IS SO DESERVING. 
03:17:30 SO ALDERMAN REILLY, AGAIN THANK YOU, I KNOW YOU WANT TO SAY A FEW 
03:17:32 WORDS. 
03:17:35 >> ALDERMAN REILLY.

03:18:18 THINGS, ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE DESTRUCTION OF A PRINTING PRESS 
03:18:22 BECAUSE SHE HAD TO FLEE MEMPHIS FOR HER OWN SAFETY, THAT'S WHY SHE 
03:18:27 CAME HERE IN CHICAGO. 
03:18:29 AND THANK GOD SHE DID. 
03:18:34 IDA B WELLS WAS AN INCREDIBLE LEADER.
