00:04:21 RECOGNIZES CHAIRMAN BURKE.

00:04:32 >> HEARING NO OBJECTION, SO ORDERED. 
00:04:46 CHAIRMAN AUSTIN, CHAIRMAN BURKE, MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL. 
00:04:50 I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND OUR ENTIRE CITY, 
00:04:54 ABOUT A CHALLENGE THAT EFFECTS CHICAGO'S FUTURE. 
00:04:58 TODAY CHICAGO'S ECONOMY IS TRONG. 
00:05:03 UNEMPLOYMENT THAT'S REACHED AN ALL-TIME LOW. 
00:05:05 LAST YEAR WE REACHED THE LARGEST DROP OF UNEMPLOYMENT OF THE TEN 
00:05:09 LARGEST CITIES IN THE COUNTRY. 
00:05:12 THERE ARE MORE JOBS TODAY THAN THERE HAVE BEEN IN THE LAST FIVE 
00:05:15 DECADES. 
00:05:16 WE HAVE BECOME THE BEST EDUCATED BIG CITY IN THE COUNTRY AND OUR LEAD 
00:05:21 IS WIDENING. 
00:05:25 WE HAVE NURTURED AND PROMOTING A THRIVING AND DRIVING TECH SECTOR 
00:05:29 FROM THE GROUND UP. 
00:05:32 AS AN EXAMPLE, SALES FORCE LAST WIEBESINGER FILLED OUT PLANS TO BUILD 
00:05:37 A NEW OFFICE TOWER FOR THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES HERE IN CHICAGO. 
00:05:42 A GROUP OF HOMEGROWN COMPANIES ANNOUNCED THEY'RE CREATING NEW JOBS 
00:05:47 AND GOOGLE ANNOUNCED A CHICAGO EXPANSION. 
00:05:50 WE HAVE MADE CHICAGO A GLOBAL HUB FOR CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH FROM 
00:05:56 COMPUTER TO ENGINEERING TO MEDICINE RESEARCH TO DATA SCIENCE. 
00:05:59 OUR ECONOMIC PROGRESS ACROSS ALL SECTORS OF OUR ECONOMY IS A 
00:06:04 TESTIMONY TO THE HARD WORK WE HAVE DONE TO INVEST IN OUR FUNDAMENTAL 
00:06:11 ECONOMIC STRENGTHS AND GROWTH. 
00:06:14 OUR TRANSFORMATION OF CITY COLLEGES IS ENSURING THAT EVERYONE FROM 
00:06:17 EVERY PART OF CHICAGO HAS A CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT GROWTH. 
00:06:21 I'M PLEASED THAT STUDENTS FROM THE ROUNDER PART OF MIDWEST, I WANT TO 
00:06:27 MAKE SURE THAT THE JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT IS COMING TO THE CITY, 
00:06:31 THAT STUDENTS GO TO OUR CITY COLLEGES TO THEIR FUTURE ARE QUALIFIED 
00:06:35 AND READY TO GO TO SUCCEED IN THE ECONOMY OF OUR 21st CENTURY. 
00:06:43 O SHARE, MIDWAY, CTA, UNION STATION HAVE SET THE STAGE OF LONG TERM 
00:06:47 GROWTH. 
00:06:48 FOR THE CITY AS A WHOLE AND NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS THE CITY. 
00:06:52 OUR SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO BRING THE OBAMA PRESIDENTIAL CENTER TO THE 
00:06:58 SOUTHSIDE WILL BRING MORE ENERGY VITALITY AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF 
00:07:02 NEW ECONOMIC TO CHICAGO. 
00:07:05 OUR POLITICAL WILL TO GET THE CITY'S OPERATING BUDGET IN ORDER HAS 
00:07:10 STRENGTHEN CHICAGO'S FISCAL FOUNDATION. 
00:07:12 OUR FOCUS OVER THE LAST 8 YEARS, A TALENT, TRAINING, TRANSPORTATION, 
00:07:23 TECHNOLOGY, TRANSPARENCY HAS HELPED CREATE THE CONTINUES OF CHICAGO 
00:07:26 TODAY AND IN THE FUTURE. 
00:07:27 THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER IN A WORLD THAT IS BECOMING MORE AND 
00:07:32 MORE UNCERTAIN EVERY DAY. 
00:07:34 FOR ALL OF THAT PROGRESS, AND FOR ALL THAT CERTAINTY, THERE IS ONE 
00:07:40 FLASHING YELLOW LIGHT OF UNCERTAINTY AND INSTABILITY ABOUT CHICAGO'S 
00:07:43 FUTURE. 
00:07:45 I'M SPEAKING OF COURSE, ABOUT OUR PENSION. 
00:07:48 FOR THE LAST 7 AND A HALF YEARS WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER TO STABILIZE, 
00:07:55 STRENGTHEN AND SECURE CHICAGO'S PENSION FUNDS. 
00:07:58 FROM OUR CITY'S PENSION FUNDS TO OUR SCHOOLS TO ALL OF OUR HISTORY. 
00:08:05 TOGETHER, WE HAVE BEEN ADDRESSING THIS KHAEJ, HONESTLY, AND 
00:08:11 FORTHRIGHTLY, TOGETHER WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS TONE SURE THE HARD 
00:08:17 WORKING CHICAGOIANS WE DEPEND ON WHO DELIVER SERVES HAVE A RETIREMENT 
00:08:22 THAT THEY CAN DEPEND ON AS WELL. 
00:08:24 BUT THERE IS MUCH MUCH MORE WORK TO STILL DO. 
00:08:27 WE KNOW THE FUTURES ARE IS NOT UNIQUE TO CHICAGO. 
00:08:31 IN CITIES IN STATES ACROSS THE AMERICA, UNFUNDED PUBLIC PENSION 
00:08:37 LIABILITIES TOTAL TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. 
00:08:41 THIS IS A KHAEJ TO THE STATE OF ILLINOIS AND ALL MUNICIPALITIES THAT 
00:08:46 MAKE UP THE STATE. 
00:08:48 WHILE THIS IS NOT UNIQUE, IT'S PRESENT IN CHICAGO AND WE MUST SOLVE 
00:08:53 IT IN CHICAGO. 
00:08:55 THE TRUTH IS GOING BACK DECADES, TOO MANY ELECTED LEADERS, TOO MANY 
00:09:00 LABOR LEADERS, TOO MANY CIVIC LEADERS, PEOPLE IN POSITIONS OF 
00:09:10 RESPONSIBILITIES AGREED TO A SYSTEM THAT WAS NOT SUSTAINABLE, AND 
00:09:13 THEREFORE IT WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE. 
00:09:15 SOME KNEW IT. 
00:09:18 AND OTHERS SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT. 
00:09:20 SIMPLY PUT, LEADERS IN THE PAST MADE COMMITMENTS WITHOUT THE 
00:09:24 RESOURCES TO BACK THEM UP AND NOW INEVITABLELY, THE TRUTH MUST COME 
00:09:34 THROUGH. 
00:09:35 I RAN FOR MAYOR TO CONFRONT OUR TOUGHEST CHALLENGES OUR FISCAL 
00:09:40 PROBLEMS HIGH AMONG THEM AND WITH THE HELP OF THIS COUNCIL WE DID 
00:09:44 ADDRESS THEM AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THEM, WE CANNOT 
00:09:46 BACKSLIDE. 
00:09:49 AS WITH ANY CHALLENGE, OWNING UP TO AN HONESTLY, FIRST STEP ON THE 
00:09:54 ROAD TO RECOVERY. 
00:09:56 THAT IS HOW WE HELPED TURN THE CORNER FOR THE OLDEST PENSION FUND IN 
00:10:00 THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, THE CHICAGO TEACHER'S PENSION FUND. 
00:10:05 THERE ARE LESSONS TO DRAW FROM BOTH POWER PENSION GROUP, HOW WE 
00:10:12 ADDRESSED IT TO STRENGTHEN IT OUT. 
00:10:16 BACK IN 1981, WHEN CPS WAS FACING FINANCIAL CHALLENGES, CITY LEADER 
00:10:22 ASHIP ALLOWED TEACH INVENTORIES REDUCE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS FROM 9% TO 
00:10:26 2%. 
00:10:28 THEN IN 1995, A SHORT TIME LATER, SPRINGFIELD CHANGED LAW TO CHANGE 
00:10:35 MONEY EARMARKED FOR PENSIONS TO BE USED TO COVER OTHER COSTS. 
00:10:38 AND I KNOW YOU FIND IT AS NO SURPRISE, THAT'S WHAT THE POWER OF FATE 
00:10:42 DID. 
00:10:44 IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED, CPS MADE LITTLE OR NO CONTRIBUTION TO 
00:10:48 TEACHER'S PENSION. 
00:10:50 THE PROBLEM WAS SO-CALLED PENSION HOLIDAYS IS WHEN THE HOLIDAY IS 
00:10:53 OVER AND THE PARTY ISING OVER, THE BILL MUST BE PAID. 
00:10:59 ON JULY FIRST, 2015, I LAID OUT A PLAN IN THIS BUILDING, FOR A 
00:11:03 THREE-WAY HANDSHAKE. 
00:11:07 BETWEEN THE TEACHERS, THE STATE, AND TAXPAYERS. 
00:11:10 TO PULL US OUT OF THE HOLE EVERYONE WOULD HAVE TO STEP UP AND DO 
00:11:14 THEIR PART. 
00:11:17 A YEAR LATER IN 2016, WE REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE TEACHER'S 
00:11:21 AGREEMENT UNION THAT NEWLY HIRED TEACHERS WOULD GO BACK TO PAYING THE 
00:11:27 FULL 9% RATHER THAN THE 2% ENDING 35 YEARS OF VIRTUAL FREE RIDE. 
00:11:33 THE FOLLOWING YEAR IN 2017, THE HISTORIC SCHOOL FUNDING FORMULA WE 
00:11:39 FOUGHT FOR FROM SPRINGFIELD WAS PASSED INTO LAW. 
00:11:42 THE STATE'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE TEACHER'S PENSIONS, ROWS FROM 12 
00:11:47 MILLION DOLLARS TO 220 MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND GROWS EVERY YEAR 
00:11:52 AFTER THAT, ENDING THE STATE'S DECADE-LONG SHORT CHANGING OF CHICAGO 
00:11:57 TEACHERS. 
00:11:58 THE BILL ALSO AUTHORIZED THE CHICAGO BOARD OF EDUCATION TO REINSTATE 
00:12:04 THE DEDICATED RESOURCED TO HELP MEET ITS PENSION OBLIGATIONS. 
00:12:09 AS A RESULT OF THOSE THREE STEPS AND AS A RESULT OF THE THREE-WAY 
00:12:14 HANDSHAKE THAT I LAID OUT, CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS NO LONGER FACE AN 
00:12:19 ANNUAL CRISIS. 
00:12:23 HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN FUNDING EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN OR PENSION 
00:12:27 FOR THE TEACHER'S RETIREMENT. 
00:12:28 IN THE FUTURE, NOT A PENNY OF CPS BUDGET WILL HAVE TO GO TO FUND 
00:12:34 PENSION, A BREAK FROM THE PAST. 
00:12:36 IN THE LAST 18 MONTHS, ALL THREE RAIDING AGENCIES HAVE SITED THE 
00:12:43 PROGRESS OF AS A REASON FOR UPGRADE IN THEIR RATINGS. 
00:12:47 AND JUST LIKE WITH THE TEACHER'S PENSIONS, MY NORTH STAR FOR ALL THE 
00:12:54 CITY'S PENSION HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PROGRESSIVE SHARED APPROACH OF 
00:12:59 REVENUE AND REFORM, CONSISTENT WITH THAT PHILOSOPHY. 
00:13:02 THE FIRST PLACE WE WENT IN THE EARLY DAYS OF MY TEN YEARS OF MAYOR TO 
00:13:07 SOLVE THE CITY'S PENSION CHALLENGES WAS TO THE BARGAINING TABLE. 
00:13:11 AS SOON AS I TOOK OFFICE WE BEGAN DISCUSSIONS WITH UNION REPRESENTING 
00:13:17 THE LABORS AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES. 
00:13:19 AT THE RATE WE WERE GOING, THE MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEE'S PLAN WAS EXPECT 
00:13:27 TODAY RUN DRY BY 2024. 
00:13:30 THE LABOR'S FUND IN 2026. 
00:13:32 THINK ABOUT THAT, SIX YEARS FROM TODAY, ONE OF THE CITY'S FOR FUNDS 
00:13:37 WAS ON TRACK FOR BANKRUPT. 
00:13:39 TO THE LABOR LEADERS, THEY DESERVE A GREAT CREDIT. 
00:13:43 THEY NOT ONLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE CHALLENGE, THEY WANTED TO BE PART OF 
00:13:47 THE SOLUTION AND THEY SAT AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE TO WORK WITH US. 
00:13:52 WORKING TOGETHER IN A SPITER OF COOPERATION, WE REACHED A FAIR 
00:13:57 AGREEMENT WITH 28 UNIONS. 
00:14:02 AUTOMATIC, UNSUSTAINABLE, 3% COMPOUNDED COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS 
00:14:05 WOULD COME DOWN AND BE IN LINE WITH WHAT RETIREES NEED AND THE FUNDS 
00:14:11 COULD AFFORD. 
00:14:13 AT THE SAME TIME THE CITY'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE PENSION FUNDS WOULD 
00:14:16 INCREASE APPROPRIATELY. 
00:14:19 LABOR LEADERS, SUPPORTED THE CHANGES. 
00:14:20 AND THEY SHOULD BE APPLAUDED. 
00:14:26 THE COUNCIL SUPPORTED THE CHANGES, YOU SHOULD BE APPLAUD FOR THA. IT 
00:14:29 WAS A SHARED APPROACH THAT PRESERVE AND PROTECTED THE PENSION FUNDS 
00:14:34 ALONG WITH THE WORKER'S RETIREMENT AND THE CITY'S CON NICK FAOU. AS 
00:14:38 YOU KNOW THE ILLINOIS SUPREME COURT, STRUCK IT DOWN, UNDER A CLAUSE 
00:14:42 THAT WAS ADDED TO THE STATE CONSTITUTION IN 1970. 
00:14:46 THE COURTS RULING ELIMINATED A BALANCE SOLUTION. 
00:14:50 BUT IT DID NOT ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM. 
00:14:53 IT JUST MADE IT HARDER TO SOLVE IN AN EQUITABLE AND FAIRWAY. 
00:15:00 SO WE REDOUBLED OUR EFFORTS, WORKED WITH THE JENNA SEM BLEED, PASSED 
00:15:05 LEGISLATION THAT PUT ALL CITY BUDGET FUNDS ON A PATH TO FUNDING. 
00:15:11 AS A RESULT, BY 2055, THE POLICE AND FIRE PENSION FUNDS WILL REACH 
00:15:16 90%. 
00:15:19 BY 2018, THE LABOR LAWS WILL REACH 90% FUNDING. 
00:15:23 WITH A FUNDING FRAMEWORK AND A SCHEDULE IN PLACE, THIS COUNCIL 
00:15:29 STEPPED UP AND DEDICATED REVENUE REVIEWS FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR ALL 
00:15:32 INDIVIDUAL FUNDS. 
00:15:34 NO LONGER WOULD OUR CITY MAKE PROMISES WITHOUT THE MEANS TO PAY FOR 
00:15:37 THEM. 
00:15:41 INSTEAD WE PROVIDED 540 BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL REVENUES FOR 
00:15:46 THE POLICE AND FIRE PENSION. 
00:15:48 OVER 240 MILLION FOR THE KNEW MISS PAL EMPLOYEES FUND AND ADDITIONAL 
00:15:53 40 MILLION FOR THE LABOR'S FUND. 
00:16:02 ALL TOTAL, SINCE 20 14, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU, THEY WERE NOT EASY 
00:16:11 VOTES. 
00:16:12 BUT THEY WERE THE RIGHT VOTES TO SECURE A STRONGER FUTURE FOR CHICAGO. 
00:16:18 AND THOSE WHO INVEST IN THE CITY TOOK NOTICE. 
00:16:21 FOR ALL THE CRITICISMS THAT THE VOTES RECEIVED, NO ONE WILL REPEAL 
00:16:24 THEM. 
00:16:28 EVERY IDEA TO ADDRESS YOUR PENSION CHALLENGE IS GOING FORWARD AND 
00:16:32 BILLS ON THE FISCAL FOUNDATION THAT WE PUT IN PLACE. 
00:16:35 WE KNOW THAT THESE VOTES WERE A BREAK WITH THE PAST IN TERMS OF BEING 
00:16:41 HONEST ABOUT THE TRUE COSTS OF PENSION. 
00:16:43 WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE RESULTED IN IMPROVED OUTLOOK FOR THE CITY AND 
00:16:49 HAVE HELPED PAVE THE WAY FOR GROWTH AND ECONOMY AND JOBS AS WELL. 
00:16:53 BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT THE FINAL STEP IN MEETING OUR 
00:16:58 OBLIGATIONS. 
00:17:02 IN 2020, WHICH IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER, THE CITY WILL NEED ANOTHER 
00:17:07 276 MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW REVENUE TO PAY FOR HIGHER POLICE AND FIRE 
00:17:14 PENSION OBLIGATIONS. 
00:17:15 LE AND TWO YEARS AFTER THAT, IN 2022 NEW REVENUE AND KNEW MISS PAL 
00:17:21 FUNDS IS PROJECTED TO INCREASE BY 310 MILLION. 
00:17:25 THESE CONTRIBUTIONS MUST BE MADE. 
00:17:28 THERE IS NO IFS ANDS OR BUTS ABOUT IT, IT'S NOT MY OPINION, THAT'S 
00:17:34 THE LAW. 
00:17:37 RETIREMENT WILL REQUIRE BOTH SMART AND TOUGH DECISION SXZ CHOICES. 
00:17:41 IT WILL REQUIRE BALANCING OUR PENSION OBLIGATIONS WITH THE OBLIGATION 
00:17:46 TO KEEP THE ECONOMY GROWING, CREATING JOBS AND MAKING CHICAGO A 
00:17:50 DESTINATION FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH BY INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE. 
00:17:54 WHILE THERE IS NO SINGLE, SOLUTION TO THIS CHALLENGE, NOT ONE IDEA 
00:17:58 THAT WILL FIX IT ALL, I BELIEVE THERE ARE IS HE QUENSTIAL STEPS. 
00:18:14 THERE IS A NEW WITH THE NEW GOVERNOR, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FOR A 
00:18:19 PROGRESSIVE INCOME TAX. 
00:18:23 THROUGHOUT MY LIFE WHILE SERVING PRESIDENT CLINTON ON AND BAM A I 
00:18:27 FOUGHT TO EXPAND THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT, EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. 
00:18:33 I BELIEVE TABSSING SHOULD BE PROGRESSIVE, IT MAKES SENSE MORALLY AND 
00:18:37 FISCALLY. 
00:18:38 THERE ARE ONLY FOUR STATES IN THE UNION LIKE OURS WITH THE 
00:18:43 CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATED FLAT TAX. 
00:18:45 THIS IS REGRESSIVE, IT IS A FISCAL STRAIGHTJACKET ON THE STATE AND 
00:18:52 DEMANDING THE CONSTITUTION IS THE ONLY WAY TO SET THINGS RIGHT SINCE 
00:18:55 1970. 
00:18:58 BUT IT WOULD BE FUNDAMENTALLY MISSED OPPORTUNITY IF WE MADE OUR TAX 
00:19:03 SYSTEM APPROPRIATELY MORE PROGRESSIVE AND LEFT IN PLACE A BENEFIT 
00:19:08 SYSTEM THAT IS REGRESSIVE. 
00:19:10 TOO MANY PEOPLE LOOK AT THE ORGANIZATION THROUGH A GREEN-EYE SHAKE 
00:19:15 N.TERMS OF DOLLARS AND CENTS. 
00:19:16 THAT'S ONE WAY TO LOOK AT T.BUT IT'S NOT THE ENTIRE WAY TO LOOK AT IT 
00:19:20 AND IT'S NL THE WHOLE PICTURE AND AT ANY TIMES THE WAY I LOOK AT IT 
00:19:22 ALONE. 
00:19:24 THE OTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THIS IN TERMS OF OUR PRINCIPLES AND 
00:19:32 PRIORITIES. 
00:19:34 WHY I'M TO A MENDING THE CLAUSE THAT CAUSES THE SUPREME COURT TO 
00:19:39 SHOOT DOWN OUR LABOR AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES. 
00:19:42 I WANT TO THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A SECOND, WHAT KIND OF SUSTAINABLE 
00:19:48 SYSTEM GUARANTEES 3% ANNUAL COMPOUNDED PAY INCREASES WHEN INFLATION 
00:19:52 HAS BEEN A BASICALLY 0 AND CURRENT EMPLOYEES HAVE AT TIMES BEEN 
00:20:00 FURLOUGH, LAID OFF OR RECEIVED MINIMUM PAY INCREASE. 
00:20:03 A COLA, A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT, IT'S SUPPOSE TO BE A COST OF 
00:20:08 LIVING ADJUSTMENT. 
00:20:10 THIS IS NOT A COLA. 
00:20:12 THIS IS A PAY RAISE. 
00:20:13 I DIDN'T GO TO BOOTH OR KELLOG LAW SCHOOL, BUT IF IT LOOKS AND ACTS 
00:20:25 LIKE A PAY RAISE, IT'S A PAY RAISE. 
00:20:28 FURLOUGHS FOR TODAY'S WORKERS. 
00:20:31 THE MANTLE OF PROGRESSIVITY MUST NOT BE PAID AND WORKED WITH ON MORE 
00:20:37 TAXES ON THE WEALTHY WHICH I'M FOR. 
00:20:39 IT MUFBT MORE RESPECT FOR OUR WORKERS PAYCHEQUES INFORMED. 
00:20:42 AND I APPLAUD OUR LABOR UNION LEADERS FOR BE WILLING TO FIX THIN HE 
00:20:49 EQUITY. 
00:20:52 THE FACT IS, A 3% ANNUAL COMPOUNDED COLA IN AN ERA OF NONEXISTENT 
00:21:00 INFLATION IS NOT PROGRESSIVE AND NOT SUSTAINABLE. 
00:21:03 NOW IT MADE SENSE IN 1970 BH WE HAD MORE WORKERS THAN RETIREES AND 
00:21:10 HIGH INFLATION, BUT NEITHER OF THOSE CASES EXIST TODAY. 
00:21:14 IN FACT OVER THE NEXT 40 YEARS, OVER THE NEXT 40 YEARS, EXPERTS 
00:21:19 ESTIMATE THAT THE CITY WILL CONTRIBUTE 42 BILLION DOLLARS TO OUR 
00:21:25 PENSION FUNDS JUST TO COVER THE COSTS OF THE 3% COMPOUNDED COLA. 
00:21:33 THAT PORTION ALONE OF THE BENEFIT SYSTEM. 
00:21:35 THAT WORKS OUT, NOW THIS IS FROM BOOTH AND KELLOG, A LITTLE MORE THAN 
00:21:41 A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE NEXT 40 YEARS. 
00:21:44 A MENDING THE STATE CONSTITUTION TO ALLOW A PROGRESSIVE INCOME TAX 
00:21:48 AND NEW AGREEMENTS WITH LABOR IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS FISCAL 
00:21:54 STABILITY AND CONSISTENT PROGRESSIVITY. 
00:21:56 COMING AT THIS CHALLENGE FROM BOTH SIDES REVENUE AND REFORM IS THE 
00:22:01 CLEAREST PATH OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE. 
00:22:03 AND THE FEAREST, I SAID THAT WHEN WE STARTED OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH 
00:22:07 LABOR, ALMOST 8 YEARS IN MY OFFICE, I BELIEVED IT THEN AND I BELIEVE 
00:22:11 IT TODAY. 
00:22:16 I KNOW IT WOULDN'T BE ACCOMPLISHED OVERNIGHT. 
00:22:18 A MENDING THE CONSTITUTION TAKES YEARS AND REQUIRES VOTES BY BOTH THE 
00:22:23 LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC. 
00:22:26 IN THE INTERIM, I SUPPORT THE CONSIDERATION MODEL WHICH PROVIDE 
00:22:29 EMPLOYEES WITH THE CHOICE OF HOW THEY WANT TO STRUCTURE THEIR OWN 
00:22:33 RETIREMENT PLANS. 
00:22:34 NOW LOOK THIS IS NOT A PERFECT ANALOGY, BUT A CONSIDERATION MODEL IS 
00:22:39 VERY CLOSE TO WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH OUR HEALTHCARE NEGOTIATIONS HERE 
00:22:43 IN THE CITY. 
00:22:45 YOUNGER WORKERS HAVE CHOOSING LESS EXPENSIVE PLANS TODAY WITH TIGHTER 
00:22:49 NETWORKS AND MORE SENIOR WORKERS ARE CHOOSING PLANS THAT WORK BEST 
00:22:53 FOR THEM AT THIS POINT IN THEIR LIVES. 
00:22:56 AND AS A RESULT, TODAY, THE CITY'S HEALTHCARE BUDGET IS 33 MILLION 
00:23:03 DOLLARS LESS THAN THE DAY I TOOK OFFICE WHEN INFLATION WAS NEARLY 30% 
00:23:11 TO 40% IN HEALTHCARE. 
00:23:13 AS A SECOND STEP, I WANT TO TURN TO A SUBJECT THAT GENERATED A LOT OF 
00:23:17 HEAT BUT VERY LITTLE LIGHT. 
00:23:19 I KNOW THAT WILL COME AS A SHOCK TO YOU. 
00:23:21 LET ME STATE WHY I BELIEVE OUR CITY SHOULD ISSUE FUNDS STABLATION 
00:23:26 BONDS. 
00:23:28 ISSUING THESE BONDS AND DEPOSITING ALL THE PROCEEDS INTO OUR PENSION 
00:23:33 FUNDS WOULD IMMEDIATELY INCREASE THE HEALTH OF OUR PENSION FUNDS TO 
00:23:36 LEVELS THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN IN AT LEAST A DECADE BEFORE ASKING FOR A 
00:23:47 SINGLE DOLLAR FROM HARD PRESSED RESIDENTS OF CHICAGO. 
00:23:52 OUR 20% FUNDED TODAY WOULD IMMEDIATELY GO TO 50%. 
00:23:55 I WANT TO WALK YOU THROUGH WHY I THINK THIS PLAN MAKES SENSE HAVING 
00:23:59 STUDIED IT FOR MONTHS AND ASKING MANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I THINK 
00:24:02 YOU'LL BE ASKING. 
00:24:04 IT'S A LOT LIKE REFINANCING YOUR MORTGAGE AT A LOWER RATE AND HERE'S 
00:24:08 HOW IT WORKS. 
00:24:09 AS A PART OF CALCULATING LIABILITIES FOR THE FUNDS, EACH OF THE 4 
00:24:17 FUNDS MAKES AN ASSUMPTION ABOUT THE INVESTMENT EARNINGS THEY EXPECT. 
00:24:22 THE ASSUMED RATE OF RETURN, RANGES FROM 7 TO 7 AND A HALF PERCENT. 
00:24:30 EXPERTS USE THE SAME LEVELS OF RETURN TO CALCULATE HOW WELL OUR 
00:24:35 PENSIONS ARE FUNDED. 
00:24:37 AS A RESULT, CHICAGO IS EFFECTIVELY PAYING 7 TO 7 AND A HALF PERCENT 
00:24:45 INTEREST ON OUR PENSION LIABILITY, OUR DEBT WHICH WE DON'T HAVE TO. 
00:24:49 WE CAN REFINANCE A PORTION OF THAT DEBT AT MUCH LOWER RATES, LOCKING 
00:24:56 IN SAVING AS AS MUCH AS TWO AND A HALF PERCENT OVER THE NEXT 40 YEARS. 
00:25:01 NOW THAT WORKS OUT TO 6 TO 7 BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVING OVER FOR 
00:25:06 CHICAGO TAXPAYER OVER THE NEXT 40 YEARS. 
00:25:11 NOT MORE DEBT, IT'S THE SAME AMOUNT OF DEBT BUT AT A MUCH LOWER AND 
00:25:17 CHEAPER COST TO TAXPAYERS AND THE CITY. 
00:25:20 NOW LET ME BE CLEAR WHAT THIS IS NOT. 
00:25:23 FIRST, UNLIKE THE STATE BONDS THAT WERE ISSUED IN 2003, THEY USE 
00:25:29 BILLIONS OF THOSE BONDS PROCEEDS TO OPERATE PLUGGING HOLES IN THEIR 
00:25:32 BUDGET. 
00:25:36 UNDER THIS STRUCTURE, ALL THE PROCEEDS MUST GO COLLECTIVELY AND 
00:25:46 DIRECTLY INTO A PENSION LOCK BOX NOWHERE ELSE. 
00:25:49 AND SECOND, UNLIKE THE PENSION BONDS THIS IS A BROWDER PLAN WITH 
00:25:54 SOURCES BACKING UP THOSE BONDS. 
00:25:56 THE STATE BONDS WERE NOT BACKED UP FOR THE PENSION. 
00:26:01 THIRD, IT'S BASED ON REALISTIC PROJECTION. 
00:26:04 THROUGH ALL THE UPS AND DOWNS IN THE HISTORY, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A 
00:26:09 30-YEAR PERIOD WHERE THE PENSIONS OF CHICAGO HAVE NOT EARNED A 3% IN 
00:26:14 THEIR INVESTMENT. 
00:26:16 THE FACT IS THAT WE AS A CITY OWE THIS MONEY. 
00:26:20 AT ONE LEVEL THE QUESTION IS SFRAIT FORWARD, ARE WE GOING TO ASK OUR 
00:26:25 TAXPAYERS TO PAY 7 AND A HALF PERCENT OR LOWER 5%. 
00:26:30 I BELIEVE THAT WHATEVER WE ASK TAXPAYERS SHOULD BE THE LOWEST AMOUNT 
00:26:35 POSSIBLE. 
00:26:37 I KNOW THIS PLAN HAS RISKS. 
00:26:39 THE TRUTH IS, THERE IS RISKS IN EVERY CHOICE AND THERE IS RISKS IF 
00:26:43 YOU DO NOTHING. 
00:26:44 THE QUESTION IS, BEFORE ALL OF THEM, AND I DON'T KNOW MEAN JUST HERE, 
00:26:50 THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE CITY, THE QUESTION IS WHICH CALCULATED RISK IS 
00:26:57 WORTH TAKING FOR THE BENEFIT GAIN? 
00:27:01 IF YOU RAISE TAXES TOO HIGH, BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES WILL NOT COME TO 
00:27:05 CHICAGO AND YOU RISK EFFECT THE HEALTH ECONOMY AND THE JOB ENGINE 
00:27:09 THAT GROWS ECONOMY. 
00:27:11 IF YOU PUT UP TOUGH CHOICES YOU DISCREDIT UPGRADES THAT COME WITH 
00:27:17 ECONOMIC. 
00:27:19 INSTEAD OF ISSUING THESE BONDS WE WOULD INSTEAD BY ISSUING THESE 
00:27:23 BONDS WE WOULD IMMEDIATELY IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE FOUR PENSION 
00:27:27 BONDS. 
00:27:29 WE WOULD DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF PRO JEKTD NEW REVENUE THAT WILL BE 
00:27:33 REQUIRED OVER THE NEXT 50 YEARS JUST TO FUND THE PENSIONS BY ALMOST 7 
00:27:37 BILLION DOLLARS. 
00:27:40 WE WOULD SAVE CHICAGO TAXPAYERS AS MUCH AS 200 MILLION DOLLARS IN 
00:27:46 NEXT YEAR'S CITY'S BUDGET WITHOUT CREATING ANYMORE TOTAL DEBT THAN WE 
00:27:49 HAVE TODAY. 
00:27:51 THE NEW REVENUE REQUIRED IN 2020, WOULD DROP FROM 276 MILLION TO 76 
00:27:58 MILLION DOLLARS. 
00:28:00 BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR OUR RETIREES AND OUR 
00:28:06 TAXPAYERS, TODAY I'LL BE INTRODUCING AN ORDINANCE THAT WILL CREATE 
00:28:09 THE NECESSARY STRUCTURE. 
00:28:17 THIS REPOSAL REQUIRES THOROUGH--AND ASK THE QUESTION, TO WHY THIS 
00:28:25 ORDINANCE IS THE FIRST OF TAOUF-STEP PROCESS. 
00:28:28 THE NEXT STEP WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COUNCIL APPROVAL TO ISSUE THE 
00:28:31 BOND. 
00:28:32 YOU WILL HAVE TWO BITES AT THE APPLE. 
00:28:36 IF THE NEXT COUNCIL OR NEXT MAYOR, WANT TO TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH, 
00:28:40 IT SUN SETS THE STRUCTURE. 
00:28:42 I WOULD AD ONE CAUTION, THAT THERE IS NOT AN ENDLESS VOTE AMOUNT OF 
00:28:47 TIME, BUT TAKE THE TIME YOU NEED. 
00:28:49 INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN GOING UP. 
00:28:52 THE FED CHAIRMAN HAS INDICATED THEY WILL HOLD STEADY FOR A WHILE BUT 
00:28:57 WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG THAT WILL BE THE CASE. 
00:29:00 THERE IS A WINDOW IN THE MARKET FOR THIS TO WORK. 
00:29:05 AT SOME POINT THAT WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY WILL CLOSE. 
00:29:08 I BELIEVE THIS STEP COULD HELP STRENGTHEN OUR PENSION FUNDS 
00:29:13 IMMEDIATELY AND ALSO ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL OF MINIMIZING COSTS TO 
00:29:15 CHICAGO TAXPAYERS. 
00:29:20 ANOTHER STEP THAT HOLDS PROMISE IS NEW REVENUE FOR GAMING. 
00:29:26 AS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN FOR CHICAGO CASINO IN THE PAST, IT'S AN IDEA I 
00:29:31 STILL SUPPORT. 
00:29:34 AT ONE MOMENT IN MY TEN YEAR, WE WERE CLOSE TO THE CITY. 
00:29:38 IF WE USE THAT NEW REVENUE TO STABILIZE PENSIONS, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
00:29:43 IT THROUGH THE END. 
00:29:46 LAST WEEK, I MET WITH REPRESENTATIVE BOB RITA TO TALK ABOUT THE 
00:29:52 CHICAGO CASINO HE'S LEADING THE EFFORT IN THE HOUSE OF 
00:29:55 REPRESENTATIVES. 
00:29:57 WE'RE LOOK RIGHT NOW AT THE IMPACT OF CASINO ON JOB CREATION, LOCAL 
00:30:05 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, TOURISM, TAX REVENUE AND CITY SERVICES. 
00:30:08 NEXT MONTH A FULL LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE WILL BE INTRODUCED IN THE 
00:30:14 GENERAL ASSEMBLY. 
00:30:17 I'LL PRESENT CHICAGO PRIORITIES IN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS. 
00:30:22 I BELIEVE A CLEAR PLAN TO REPRESENT ONE PIECE OF A BROADER FOUR-PART 
00:30:34 STRATEGY. 
00:30:38 LIKE WISE, ILLINOIS LEGISLATURES WILL BE MAKING A SERIOUS LOOK AT 
00:30:44 LOCATE EYESING LEGALIZING MARIJUANA. 
00:30:47 THAT WILL GO TOWARDS STRENGTING OUR PENSION FUNDS AND SECURING THE 
00:30:53 RETIREMENT ON WORKERS WHO DEPEND IT. 
00:30:56 I BELIEVE RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA HAS SOCIAL COSTS THAT MUST BE 
00:30:58 CONSIDERED. 
00:31:02 AND LIKE A CASINO WILL BE TIME TO PATH. 
00:31:06 BUT IF THE SFAIT GOES DOWN THAT FAGT THOSE RESOURCES SHOULD GO TO 
00:31:13 SOLIDIFY OUR PENSIONS WITHOUT ASKING MORE FROM OUR TAXPAYERS. 
00:31:16 IF WE TAKE ALL OF THESE STEPS, THE CONSIDERATION, THE A MENDING THE 
00:31:24 SKON STAOU, NE GOERK NEW CONTRACTS, ISSUING BONDS, CASINO AND 
00:31:30 RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA, WE'LL REDUCE WHAT IS ASKED OF OUR TAXPAYERS 
00:31:34 TO MEET THOSE OBLIGATIONS OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. 
00:31:37 WE WILL MEET OUR GOALS OF STABILIZING CHICAGO PENSION FUNDS AND 
00:31:42 ASKING THE LEAST AMOUNT FROM CHICAGO TAXPAYERS. 
00:31:47 THE CITY OF CHICAGO'S PENSION CHALLENGE HAS ACCRUED OVER DECADES AND 
00:31:53 WILL NOT BE SOLVED OVERNIGHT. 
00:31:55 WE GOT INTO THIS CHALLENGE, BECAUSE OF ELECTED OFFICIALS AND LABOR 
00:32:01 LEADERS MADE PROMISES WITHOUT TELLING THE FULL TRUTH ABOUT WHAT THEY 
00:32:04 WOULD COSTS. 
00:32:06 EVEN WHEN THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM BECAME CLEAR, IT WAS EASIER TO TURN 
00:32:12 A BLIND EYE. 
00:32:14 BUT TOGETHER OVER THE LAST 8 YEARS, WE TOOK A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT 
00:32:19 APPROACH, RATHER THAN PASSING THE BUCK, WE'VE DIRECTED BILLIONS OF 
00:32:24 DOLLARS SHOWINGER UP OUR PENSION BONDS AND FUNDS. 
00:32:28 RATHER THAN BURYING OUR HEADS IN THE SAND, WE HAVE CON FRONTED OUR 
00:32:34 PENSION CHALLENGES WITH HONESTY AND AND CLARITY TO OUR WORKERS WITH 
00:32:40 INTEGRITY. 
00:32:45 FOR WORKERS AND EMPLOYEES, PENSSING REPRESENT THE YEARS OF SHOWING UP 
00:32:52 EVERY DAY TO WORK. 
00:32:54 YOU HAVE MADE IT YOUR LIFE'S WORK AS WELL TO DO YOUR JOB AND KEEP 
00:32:58 YOUR WORD AND LIVE UP TO YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. 
00:33:02 AND I COMMEND YOU FOR IT. 
00:33:05 WHATEVER THE RESULTS OF YOU UPCOMING ELECTIONS, WE CANNOT AFFORD TO 
00:33:08 RETURN THE POLITICS OF THE PAST WHERE PROMISES ARE MADE WITHOUT THE 
00:33:13 MEANS TO FILL THEM OR WE REFUSE TO CONFRONT CHALLENGES BY THE CHOICE 
00:33:17 THAT'S WE REQUIRE. 
00:33:19 WE CANNOT A LOUT BOULDER WE HAVE PUSHED UP THE HILL OVER THE LAST 
00:33:26 YEAR THE LAST 8 YEARS TO ROLL BACK DOWN. 
00:33:29 IT'S NOT FAIR TO OUR WORKERS, RETIREES, TAXPAYERS AND IT'S NOT FAIR 
00:33:32 TO OUR CHILDREN AND YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO WANT TO MAKE THEIR 
00:33:36 FUTURES HERE. 
00:33:38 THE REASON CHICAGO HAS MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS, BECAUSE CHICAGOIANS ARE 
00:33:44 NOT AFRAID TO DO HARD THINGS. 
00:33:46 WE DO NOT RUN AWAY FROM OUR CHALLENGES. 
00:33:49 WE HAVE CONFRONTED THEM AND CONTINUE TO CONFRONT THEM HEAD ON. 
00:33:53 WE TURNED THE SHORTEST SCHOOL DAY AND SCHOOL YEAR IN A COUNTRY INTO A 
00:33:59 SCHOOL YEAR FOR A CHILD. 
00:34:03 WE ENSURED EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION FOR ALL OUR CHILDREN. 
00:34:07 ADDING FOUR YEARS TO EDUCATION TO A CHILD TODAY THAN WHERE FFS 
00:34:11 DECADES AGO. 
00:34:17 WE PUT FINANCIAL IN CPS IN THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS. 
00:34:21 AND TODAY OUR CHILDREN ARE BETTER PREPARED TO SEAS OPPORTUNITIES AND 
00:34:25 EXCEL IN THE FUTURE. 
00:34:27 WE TRANSFORMED THE CITY COLLEGES INTO THE BEST COLLEGE SYSTEM IN THE 
00:34:34 COUNTRY, SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE GRADUATION RAID, AND HARVEY TO 
00:34:40 MALCOLM X STUDENTS FROM CHICAGO ARE ATTENDING COLLEGE FREE, AND 
00:34:47 THEY'RE GRADING DEBT FRAOU. 
00:34:50 WE HAVE MADE TRANSFORMATION THAT HAVE NOT SEEN CHANGES IN DECADES. 
00:34:54 TO NEW GROCERY STORES, TO NEW OIL STATIONS, TO NEW PARKS AND 
00:34:59 PLAYGROUNDS THAT MAKE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS GREAT PLACE TO SEE LIVE, WORK 
00:35:02 AND RAISE A FAMILY. 
00:35:04 WE TURN CHICAGO INTO A TWO-WATER FRONT CITY AND STRENGTHEN OUR CITY'S 
00:35:11 FOUNDATION INCLUDING MOANEDERIZATION AT OUR AIRPORTS AND MASS TRANSIT 
00:35:15 SYSTEM THAT WILL KEEP CHICAGO MOVING INTO THE FUTURE. 
00:35:17 THESE ARE NOT JUST THINGS THAT JUST MADE A THING TODAY OR TOMORROW, 
00:35:22 BUT THEY MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR GENERATION. 
00:35:24 THEY WILL STAND THE TEST OF TIME AND BE WORTHY OF OUR TIME IN PUBLIC 
00:35:28 SERVICE. 
00:35:30 THAT IS WHY I KNOW AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN TACKLE THIS 
00:35:34 CHALLENGE TOO. 
00:35:38 BY MARSHALING THE SAME GRIT TO MAKE THAT PROGRESS, WE CAN CONTINUE TO 
00:35:42 MAKE PROGRESS IN OUR PENSIONS. 
00:35:44 THTS LAST SUMMIT DECLINE, WITH CAN DUR, WITH COURAGE AND WITH A 
00:35:50 COMMITMENT TO WORK TOGETHER, WE CAN RISE TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE AS WE 
00:35:55 HAVE RISEN TO FACE EVERY CHALLENGE FACING THIS GREAT CITY. 
00:35:57 THANK YOU. 
00:35:58 [APPLAUSE] 
00:36:12 [GAVEL] 
00:36:13 >> MAYOR MEMBER. 
00:36:16 >> YOUR HONOR, I NOW MOVE THAT WE TURN TO THE REGULAR BUSINESS.

00:36:41 ANY COMMENT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR AUTOMATIC REVIEW. 
00:36:44 FIRST SPEAKER IS MR. GEORGE BLAKEMOORE. 
00:36:57 >> CITIZENS, WHEN SOMEBODY COME TO SPEAK FROM THE PUBLIC, EVERYONE OF 
00:37:05 ELECTED OFFICIALS SHOULD BE SEATED AND LISTENING TO THE CITIZENS. 
00:37:09 THIS IS NOT A MEET AND GREET SESSION. 
00:37:16 I WATCHED MANY TIMES, CITIZEN GET EACH AND SPEAK AND YOU ALL TURN 
00:37:19 AROUND AND TALK TO EACH OTHER. 
00:37:21 THERE IS A CRISIS HERE IN OUR CITY. 
00:37:27 OVER 200,000 BLACKS HAVE LEFT THE CITY OF CHICAGO, 200,000! 
00:37:36 WHY DID THESE 200,000 BLACK CITIZENS DECIDE TO LEAVE CHICAGO? 
00:37:43 WHY WAS IT 200,000 WHITE LEAVING THE CITY? 
00:37:48 200,000 HISPANICS, NO NO NO NO NO NO! 
00:37:51 200,000 BLACK. 
00:37:52 THE BIG QUESTION IS WHY? 
00:37:56 BECAUSE BLACK PEOPLE ARE NOT RECEIVING GOOD JOB CONTRACTING SERVICE. 
00:38:04 THEY DON'T NEED US ANYMORE. 
00:38:06 THEY SAY. 
00:38:12 MIGRATED UP HERE FOR THE GREAT MIE GHRAIBSINGER BUT NOW WE'RE GOING 
00:38:20 DOWN SOUTH. 
00:38:24 INTUITION AL PLACES, NBs AND WBs I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT! 
00:38:29 A SANCTUARY CITY SOUTHBOUND A SANCTUARY FOR BLACK PEOPLE! 
00:38:34 LEGAL AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT BELONG HERE. 
00:38:38 THEY DO NOT AND THEY COME HERE TO COMPETE WITH BLACK PEOPLE FOR GOOD 
00:38:47 CONTRACTOR JOBS! 
00:38:48 EVEN TAKE OVER YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. 
00:38:51 TAKE OVER YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. 
00:38:54 TO THE EXTENT THAT SOME BLACK PEOPLE SAID I'M GOING TO PACK UP AND 
00:39:00 LEAVE CHICAGO, 200,000! 
00:39:03 TO OUR VOTING BLOCK IS DWINDING. 
00:39:06 BUT WE HAVE SO-CALLED BLACK LEADERSHIP, BLACK ELECTED OFFICIALS. 
00:39:13 HAVE YOU ASKED YOURSELF BLACK ELECTED OFFICIAL WHY ARE BLACK PEOPLE 
00:39:19 MIGRATING OUT OF CHICAGO? 
00:39:21 AND WHY ARE WHITE MOVING INTO CHICAGO? 
00:39:26 CHICAGO MUST HAVE SOMETHING GOOD FOR THESE ETHNIC GROUPS AND THEY 
00:39:31 MUST HAVE SOMETHING BAD FOR BLACK PEOPLE? 
00:39:34 THEY NOT LEAVING. 
00:39:37 THEY COMING, WHY ARE WE LEAVING? 
00:39:39 POLICE BRUTALITY? 
00:39:44 POOR FOOD. 
00:39:51 NOT NOT AFFORDABLE HOUSING, INSTITUTIONAL RATE SYSTEM. 
00:39:53 SO IS DOWN SOUTH AND IS UP HERE. 
00:39:56 BUT AT LEAST THESE PEOPLE. 
00:39:58 >> THANK YOU, MR. BLAKEMOORE. 
00:40:00 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JACKIE PAGE. 
00:40:09 >> GOOD MORNING ALDERMAN AND MERRY CHRISTMAS. 
00:40:12 I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I ATTENDED A FORUM LAST NIGHT AND SIX OF THE 
00:40:19 MAYORAL CANDIDATES SAID THAT THEY AGREE WITH CURTAILING THE 
00:40:26 PRIVILEGES OF YOUR BODY. 
00:40:28 AND ONE OF THOSE CANDIDATES WAS FORMER MEMBER OF YOUR AUGUST BODY, 
00:40:34 TONY BARWINKLE. 
00:40:38 THE CROWD SEEMED TO BE IN AGGREEANCE THAT THE ALDERMAN HAVE TOO MUCH 
00:40:42 PRIVILEGE. 
00:40:44 NOW HOW DID THE ALDERMAN, HOW DID THE PUBLIC COME TO THIS OPINION OF 
00:40:50 YOU ALDERMAN? 
00:40:53 IT IS BECAUSE WHEN THEY TURN TO YOU, YOU DON'T LISTEN. 
00:40:59 IF YOU DON'T LISTEN, THEN THE PUBLIC WILL TURN AGAINST YOU. 
00:41:03 I HAVE BEEN COMING TO THIS AUGUST BODY MONTHS AND MONTHS, TELLING YOU 
00:41:11 ABOUT CONTRACTS AND PRACTICES THAT ARE AGAINST THE WISHES OF A GROUP 
00:41:20 OF CITIZENS THAT I REPRESENT, WHICH IS THE CHSA VOUCHER HOLDER. 
00:41:24 I HAVE ASKED FOR SUPPORT, SOME OF YOU HAVE IGNORED. 
00:41:30 I REMEMBER I ASKED FOR A MEETING. 
00:41:33 AND ONE OF YOU ALDERMAN TOLD ME THAT YOU WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN A 
00:41:36 MONTH. 
00:41:38 NOW, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT SHOULD BE TOLD TO A CITIZEN WHO 
00:41:44 COMES TO YOU WHO REPRESENTS A BODY THAT IS 40,000 OR BETTER IN THE 
00:41:51 CITY OF CHICAGO. 
00:41:54 THERE ARE 40,000, ALMOST 50,000 REALLY VOUCHER HOLDERS IN THE CITY OF 
00:41:59 CHICAGO AND THEY'RE ALL 50 WARDS. 
00:42:01 SO YOU GUYS NEED TO PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE YOU DON'T LISTEN, THERE ARE 
00:42:08 TWO VOUCHER HOLDERS THAT ARE RUNNING FOR TWO OF YOUR SEATS. 
00:42:12 YOU NEED TO PAY ATTENTION WHEN PEOPLE COME HERE SO THEN THEY WILL NOT 
00:42:17 COME AND RUN AGAINST YOU TO TAKE YOUR SEATS. 
00:42:20 WE ARE TELLING YOU THAT THINGS ARE NOT WORKING AND YOU NEED TO LISTEN. 
00:42:26 WHEN WE ASK YOU FOR AN AUDIENCE, GIVE US ONE. 
00:42:30 WE MAY HAVE THE SOLUTIONS TO YOUR PROBLEM. 
00:42:32 WE MAY COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT MAY HELP YOU. 
00:42:37 WHEN WE SAY SOMETHING IS NOT WORKING, LISTEN. 
00:42:43 >> THANK YOU. 
00:42:45 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS EVANGELE. 
00:43:04 >> HALLELUJAH. 
00:43:08 DECEMBER 18, 2018, MARKS THE 23rd OF 13th AMENDMENT OF SLAVERY AND 
00:43:17 SERVITUDE AS A WHERE THE PARTY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DUELLY CONVICTED.

00:44:56 MURDERED FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHTS TO BE CITIZENS IN THE LAND OF OUR 
00:45:00 BIRTH. 
00:45:04 PATRIOTIC HISTORIC, RELIGIOUS AND ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION TO ORGANIZE 
00:45:07 AND PARTICIPATE IN THE AN VERSE PREACTIVITIES, IT ASSISTS STATES 
00:45:14 LOCALITY NOT FOR ORGANIZATION AND FURTHER THE COMMEMORATION OF 400

00:46:38 BUT TODAY, I SPEAK TO YOU AS A MOTHER, AS A GRAND MOERKTS A GREAT 
00:46:49 GRANDMOTHER, AN AUNT, AND COUSIN. 
00:46:52 AND I KNOW THAT THIS MAY NOT BE THE ITEM THAT IS COMING UP ON YOUR 
00:46:57 AGENDA TODAY, BUT I NEED TO SAY THAT, 95 MILLION PLUS JUST SEEMS TO 
00:47:05 BE EXCESSIVE TO ME WHEN THE NEIGHBORHOODS NEED THINGS LIKE, MENTAL 
00:47:15 HEALTH INSTITUTIONS, BERT SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
00:47:18 WE HAVE SOME GOOD SCHOOLS HERE IN ILLINOIS, CHICAGO BUT THAINER IN 
00:47:24 ALL THE NEIGHBORHOODS. 
00:47:26 YOU HAVE VETERANS, MANY HOMELESS PEOPLE, YOU NEED AFTER SCHOOL THINGS 
00:47:33 FOR KIDS TO GET OFF OF THE STREET SO. MY POINT IS, I'M REALLY ASKING 
00:47:40 FOR YOU TO REEVALUATE THE COP ACADEMY. 
00:47:45 I THINK 95 MILLION, PLUS IT'S GOING TO BE MORE THAN THAT. 
00:47:48 IS REALLY A LOT OF MONEY WHEN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS IN DIRE NEED OF SO 
00:47:55 MANY THINGS. 
00:47:59 LAST NIGHT, AT THE FORUM, SEVERAL CANDIDATES BROUGHT UP SOME SPECIFIC 
00:48:12 NUMBERS FOR MISAPPROPRIATED FUNDS.

00:54:11 MRANL. 
00:54:13 WE RESPECTFULLY URGE THE CITY COUNCIL TO DELAY THE VOTE ON THIS VOTE 
00:54:18 FOR ALL THE REASONS YOU'LL HEAR TODAY. 
00:54:21 THE COMPLEXITY OF ADDRESSING THE CITY'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRIES, A 
00:54:26 DELAY VOTE IS NECESSARY BECAUSE IT FALLS CRITICALLY SHORT OF STATE 
00:54:31 GOALS NOTABLY IN THE FUNDING COMMITMENT OUTLINED IN THE PLAN 
00:54:37 P.COPPERFIELD COMPLAINT TO ALSO KNOW ONE PIECE OF MESSAGING, ON PAGE 
00:54:42 FOUFRT PLAN IT'S STATED AS THE WORLD CLASS CITY, CHICAGO IS 
00:54:50 ATTRACTING NEW BUSINESSES AND NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. 
00:54:56 FOR BOTH LOCAL AND ECONOMY AND MUNICIPAL PROGRAM. 
00:55:03 IN 2018.7% OF CITY HOUSEHOLD EARNED MORE THAN 100,000. 
00:55:09 BY 2016, THAT ROSE TO 26.2%. 
00:55:13 THEY WILL CREATE WHAT ARE NEW NEIGHBORHOOD OVER THE NEXT DECADE. 
00:55:18 ALTHOUGH THE FLAN WANTS TO KNOW THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES IN TERMS OF 
00:55:24 DIS PLACING THE CURRENT RESIDENTS, THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR THAT THIS IS 
00:55:27 GOOD FOR THE CITY. 
00:55:29 WE STAND NO CHANCE IN FINDING THE MARKET FORCES THAT DISRUPT 
00:55:36 COMMUNITIES UNLESS YOU REJECT THIS NARRATIVE. 
00:55:37 WE DO NOT FEEL THAT THE WHOLELE NEIGHBORHOOD CHANGE NEEDS TO BE IN 
00:55:41 THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. 
00:55:43 WE BELIEVE THAT THE CITY OF CHICAGO CAN LIVE UP TO THE PRINCIPLES IN 
00:55:47 THIS PLAN BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO, WE NEED THE ACTUAL RESOURCES AND 
00:55:53 PROBLEMATIC COMMITMENTS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. 
00:55:54 THANK YOU. 
00:55:56 >> THANK YOU. 
00:55:58 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS DIANE LIMA. 
00:56:11 >> GOOD MORNING. 
00:56:15 MY NAME IS DIANE LIMAS AND I'M A VOLUNTEER LEADER FOR UNITED LOCATED 
00:56:22 ON THE NORTHWEST SIDE OF CHICAGO. 
00:56:23 WE ARE ALSO A MEMBER OF THE JUST HOUSING LEAD COALITION. 
00:56:27 THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. 
00:56:30 FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING FOR 
00:56:35 ALL OF THEIR DEDICATION AND HARD WORK AND PUTTING THE NEXT FIVE-YEAR 
00:56:38 PLAN TOGETHER. 
00:56:40 THIS DRAFT PLAN HAS MANY FAVORABLE FEATURES THAT WE VALUE SUCH AS 
00:56:47 ADDING PAIR, PRESERVING AFFORD ANL RENTALS AS A-LINE ITEM THIS THIS 
00:56:49 PLAN. 
00:56:51 HOWEVER THIS PLAN LACKS THE FUNDING AND COMMITMENTED NEEDED TO CARRY 
00:56:55 THIS PLAN OUT. 
00:56:57 THE DPRAFT RECOGNIZES THE SERIOUSNESS AND IMPORTANCE OF CHICAGO 
00:57:01 HOUSING NEEDS AND THE PROBLEM THAT'S COMES WITH IT. 
00:57:05 THIS PLAN TALKS ABOUT PUTTING AN END TO SEGREGATION STOPPING 
00:57:08 DISPLACEMENT. 
00:57:11 THE NEED FOR PRESERVATION OF RENTAL UNITS. 
00:57:14 PROTECTING OUR TWO TO FOUR HOUSING STOCK AND SO ON. 
00:57:17 THE PLAN SAYS ALL THE RIGHT THINGS, USES ALL THE RIGHT WORDS. 
00:57:22 HOWEVER THE WORDS MEAN NOTHING WITHOUT THE PROPER AMOUNT OF FUNDING 
00:57:26 AND THE COMMITMENT FROM THE MAYOR TO MAKE THE CHANGE THAT WE NEED 
00:57:29 HAPPEN. 
00:57:33 THE PLAN ACKNOWLEDGES THAT FORECLOSURE CRISIS HAS BEEN DAMAGING TO 
00:57:37 OUR LOW TO MODERATE INCOME COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY OUR 
00:57:42 AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO FAMILIES. 
00:57:44 AS PEOPLE OF COLOR CONTINUE TO LEAD THIS CITY, ONE OF THE REASONS 
00:57:48 BEING THAT HOUSING HAS BECOME TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO 
00:57:52 LIVE HERE. 
00:57:54 THIS PLAN DOES NOT DO ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THIS. 
00:57:59 THE PLANS STATE THAT PRESERVING EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS COST 
00:58:03 EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE. 
00:58:05 HOWEVER THE PLANNING ENCOURAGES NEW DEVELOPMENT THAT CREATES MOSTLY 
00:58:10 STUDIO AND ONE-BEDROOM UNITS. 
00:58:14 AGAIN, DISPLACEMENT AND DISPLACING AND PUSHING OUR FAMILIES OUT. 
00:58:18 HECK, WE LOST 20,000 UNITS OF NATURAL A OCCURRING IN OUR TWO TO FOUR 
00:58:24 UNIT BUILDINGS FROM 2010 TO 2016 ALONE. 
00:58:28 HOWEVER THE PLAN ONLY DEDICATED 10 MILLION DOLLARS TO THE NEW 
00:58:30 PROGRAM, CARE PROGRAM. 
00:58:33 WITH THE EXPECT ANS OF PRESERVING A MEAGER AMOUNT OF 100 AFFORDABLE 
00:58:38 UNITS IN FIVE YAEFRMENTZ THE PLAN REPORTS THAT IN 2016, 26.2% OF 
00:58:45 PEOPLE LIVE IN THE CITY MAKE MORE THAN $100,000 A YEAR. 
00:58:50 THESE WEALTHY FOLKS ARE CREATING NEW NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE 
00:58:55 DISPLACING OUR EXISTING RESIDENTS, ESPECIALLY IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT 
00:58:59 ARE SHOWING SIGN OF GENTRIFICATION, HAVING SAID THIS, WE'RE ASKING 
00:59:08 THE BOARD TO POSTPONE THE VOTE. 
00:59:10 THE NEW MAYBESINGER THE NEW CITY COUNCIL. 
00:59:13 THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING NEED TO BE PART OF THESE DISCUSSIONS. 
00:59:17 >> THANK YOU. 
00:59:25 >> THE NEXT SPEAKER IS FRANK AVOLON. 
00:59:38 >> GOOD MORNING, ANY MAIM IS FRANK AVENUE LOAN. 
00:59:45 I'M THE CONVENER OF JUSTICE LEAGUE A COTS ENTIRE STAIFT CHICAGO 
00:59:51 DEDICATE TODAY WORKING FOR JUSTICE AND PEOPLE CENTER POLICIES AND 
00:59:55 PROGRAMS IN THE CITY'S UPCOMING FIVE-YEAR PLAN. 
00:59:57 I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING DEPUTY COMMISSIONER ANTHONY AND HIS 
01:00:04 STAFF FOR THE EXCELLENT JOB THAT THEY DID IN THE VERY HARD TASK OF 
01:00:09 PULLING TOGETHER THE RESOURCES TO COME UP WITH THIS DRAFT PLAN. 
01:00:14 NEVERTHELESS, WHILE THERE ARE MANY STRONG PARTS OF THE DRAFT, THE 
01:00:19 JUSTICE LEAGUE RESPECTIVELY "COUNCIL POSTPONE ITS VOTE ON THE PLAN 
01:00:23 GOES TO ALLOW A FURTHER DELIBERATIONS THAT MIGHT TAKE PLACE. 
01:00:27 THE LEAGUE BELIEVES THAT THE TEXT OF THE DRAFT HAS MANY STRONG 
01:00:32 ASPECTS, FOR EXAMPLE, RECOGNITION OF THE ILLS OF DISPLACEMENT AND 
01:00:43 GENTRIFICATION, RECOGNITION OF HEALTHY HOMES PRINCIPLES FOR FAMILIES 
01:00:46 AND CHILDREN, AND THERE IS EVEN ONE LINE RECOGNITION THAT MAY BE JUST 
01:00:53 MAYBE CLIMATE CHANGE HAS SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT HOW WE INSTRUCT OUR 
01:00:57 NEIGHBORHOOD. 
01:01:00 THESE AND OTHER ACKNOWLEDGES ARE LOTABLE, HOWEVER THERE IS A 
01:01:05 DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE TEXT AND THE BUDGET PROGRAM THAT APPEAR IN THE 
01:01:08 APPENDIX. 
01:01:11 THE BUDGET DOES NOT MATCH THE PROBLEM ENUNCIATED IN THE TAX. 
01:01:17 THEY'RE UNDER FUNDED, PROGRAMS, REALIZE FAR TOO HEAVY ON SO-CALLED 
01:01:21 MARKET BASE INITIATIVE THAT DO NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES 
01:01:26 EXPRESSED IN THE TEXT ITSELF. 
01:01:28 SOME HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THE GAP IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS 120 
01:01:31 UNITS. 
01:01:34 MOST BELIEVE THAT IT'S FAR MORE THAN THAT. 
01:01:38 SOME HAVE CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATED THAT THE AFFORDABLE GAP IS A 26 
01:01:41 BILLION DOLLARS PROBLEM AT THE MOST CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES. 
01:01:46 YET THE BUDGET IS SET AT 1.3 BILLION OVER FIVE YEARS. 
01:01:54 THAT'S LESS THAN 0.32% IN THE CITY'S BUDGET, AN EMBARRASS AMOUNT. 
01:01:59 IT WAS THE SAME AMOUNT THAT WAS SPENT IN THE MRAFT PLAN DESPITE FACT 
01:02:03 THAT THE FAX RECOGNIZES THAT THE CHALLENGES ARE GREATER. 
01:02:06 IN SHORT THE TEXT OF THE PLAN RECOGNIZES A HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF 
01:02:11 CHALLENGES AND PROBLEMS TO OVERCOME WITH THE BUDGET AND FRAM DO NOT 
01:02:15 STEP UP TO THE PLATE. 
01:02:17 THE TRAIN IS LEAVING THE STATION, WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER FIVE YEARS OF 
01:02:22 LOW-GRADE ACTIVITY WHILE WE THINK OF SOMETHING DIFFERENT, GENT 
01:02:29 CONTINUED RIFCA AND DISPLACEMENT IS HAPPENING NOW. 
01:02:38 IN SHORT, THE DPRAFT PLAN IS COMMENDABLE BUT WE CAN AND MUST DO 
01:02:41 BETTER. 
01:02:42 >> THANK YOU. 
01:02:45 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS WALLACE BRADLEY. 
01:02:53 >> FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY TO GOD BE THE GLORY. 
01:02:59 I'M READING A LOST STORIES AND HEARING A LOT ELECTED OFFICIALS. 
01:03:05 ALL OF A SUDDEN, PEOPLE LOVE THE FACT THAT THEY SELL MARIJUANA TO PAY 
01:03:08 THE BILL. 
01:03:10 WE HEARD THAT THE LOTTERY WAS TO HELP TO PAYOFF THE EDUCATION BILL. 
01:03:17 I JUST WANT TO SAY, WE ARE COMING TO AN AIRWAY WHERE WE'RE ABOUT TO 
01:03:22 HAVE A NEW MAYOR. 
01:03:24 SOME NEW ALDERMAN. 
01:03:29 I FEEL THAT IF MARIJUANA GET LEGALIZE IN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, AND 
01:03:34 GETS LEGALIZED IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO, YOU NEED TO MAKE IT A LAW OR 
01:03:43 OSH NARD NANS THAT SOMEBODY NEED TO GO TO THE COMMUNITY DOES NOT GET 
01:03:51 BENEFIT OF REDEVELOPMENT. 
01:03:53 DON'T FALL ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL LIKE WE DID WHEN THEY TOOK THE POLICY 
01:04:00 AND MADE TT LOTTERY AND WE DIDN'T GET NO BENEFIT. 
01:04:05 AND THAT WAS THE LOTTERY IN OUR COMMUNITY OR--WELL THAT WAS A BAD FOR 
01:04:12 US. 
01:04:14 YOU CAN GO TO THE POLICY MAN AND GET A LOAN. 
01:04:18 SO I'M SAYING NOW THAT MARIJUANA IS ABOUT TO BECOME KING, THIS BODY 
01:04:25 GOT A RIGHT TO SAY, IF YOU TAKE A PENNY OFF EACH JOINT OR EACH DRU, 
01:04:33 IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED TO THE WARDS, THEY GOT THE MOST LOTS IN THEM. 
01:04:38 AND DON'T LET THE MONEY THAT COME FROM MARIJUANA, GET USED LIKE THE 
01:04:45 TIFF MONEY THAT'S BEEN USED DOWNTOWN AND NOT IN THE COMMUNITY THAT IT 
01:04:49 WAS MEANT TO BE USED MORE. 
01:04:53 --FOR. 
01:04:55 [APPLAUSE] 
01:04:57 SO WE HAVE A CHANCE WITH THIS NEW LEADERSHIP THAT IS COMING INTO 
01:05:04 PLACE, BY THE GRACE OF GOD, TO YOU THE BLOOD TAX TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE 
01:05:09 WITHIN OUR WARS THAT IS DIS EN FRAN XHIEZ. 
01:05:13 AGAIN, I THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO ME. 
01:05:15 >> THANK YOU. 
01:05:20 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ERNIE LUCASET. 
01:05:27 >> GOOD MORNING. 
01:05:29 MY NAME IS ERNIE AND I'M THE HOUSING ORGANIZER ON NORTHWEST SIDE 
01:05:33 CENTER. 
01:05:37 A HUD NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION SERVING ALL OF CHICAGO AND VARIOUS 
01:05:40 SUBURBS. 
01:05:42 WE HAVE LONG BEEN AN ADVOCATE OF HOUSING JUSTICE AND I WANTED THE 37 
01:05:48 MEMBERS OF THE CHICAGO LEAGUE. 
01:05:50 OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO HOLD THE CITY COUNCIL ACCOUNTABLE AND RESPONSIBLE 
01:05:53 ONLY THE VOTE OF THE CITY'S FIVE-YEAR HOUSING PLAN. 
01:05:57 WE ARE ASKING THE COUNCIL TO STOP THE VOTE ON THE 5-YEAR PLAN UNTIL 
01:06:02 AFTER THE ELECTION AND TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE INADEQUACY TO AS TO 
01:06:13 OPEN THE DOORS FOR AMENDMENT TO THE PLAN NEXT YEAR UNDER A NEW MAYOR, 
01:06:17 NEW COUNCIL AND NEW DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING. 
01:06:21 WE APPRECIATE MANY OF THE STATEMENTS IN THE NARRATIVE OF THE 
01:06:24 FIVE-YEAR PLAN. 
01:06:26 BUT THE BUDGET AND THE PROGRAMMING DO NOT MATCH WITH THE ISSUES AND 
01:06:32 AMBITIONS THAT WERE PRESENTED. 
01:06:36 THE FUNDING 1.535 MILLION DOLLARS NEEDS TO BE INCREASED AT LEAST 
01:06:40 THREE-FOUR TIMES THE AMENDMENT 'EM FA SIZING THE GREATER COMMITMENT 
01:06:45 CITY COOPERATION FUNDS. 
01:06:48 WHILE MANY OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE COMMUNITIES JUSTICE LEAGUE 
01:06:51 REPRESENTED ACROSS THE CITY, WHILE MANY HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED AND MANY 
01:06:54 HAVE NOT. 
01:06:56 AMENDMENTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AMONG THEM JUST CAUSE FOR EVICTION, 
01:07:00 FOR THE SLOWING OF DISPLACEMENT AND GENTRIFICATION HOME 
01:07:10 REMODIFICATION WHICH INCLUDES MOLD. 
01:07:11 THAT THEY WORK WITH NONPROFIT ON THE WEST SIDE COLLECTIVELY TO CREATE 
01:07:17 LAND TRUSTS. 
01:07:18 THEY HAVE THE FLEXIBLE TO LEVERAGE OTHER FUNDS TO BRING THIS TO SCALE. 
01:07:24 I DO NOT WISH TO BE SKEPTICAL TO COUNCIL BUT MANY TIMES THE COUNCIL 
01:07:32 HAS NOT TAKEN APPROPRIATE TIME OF RAMIFICATION ON PLANS AND PROPOSAL 
01:07:39 WITH THE CONTROVERSY OF TWO QUORUMS BEING QUESTIONED THIS WEEK AS 
01:07:43 WELL AS A MAYORAL ELECTION WITH A DOZEN OR MORE CANDIDATES WITH 
01:07:48 DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON TIFF AND AROs PLUS A POSSIBLE CHANGE FROM 12 TO 
01:08:01 15, WE ASK THAT THE VOTE BE DELAYED UNTIL AFTER THE MAYORAL ELECTION. 
01:08:07 COMMON SENSE SHOULD REVEIL WHY STRADDLE A PLAN THAT THEY HAVE TO 
01:08:13 ADHERE TO FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, THAT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH. 
01:08:18 I ASK THAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE WHAT IS THE BEST FOR THE CITY AND TAKE 
01:08:24 RESPONSIBLE ACTION TO DELAY THIS VOTE. 
01:08:27 AND PLEASE, HAVE A ROLL CALL SO YOUR CONSTITUENCE HAVE A RECORD OF 
01:08:33 THIS VOTE. 
01:08:34 >> THANK YOU.

01:10:04 SERGEANT MADE A CALL FOR HIS CALL FOR BAUNG FROM HIS CELL PHONE. 
01:10:09 IN CONSIDER AS SERGEANT CALLED THE ASSAILANT SEVERAL BLOCKS UNTIL HE 
01:10:20 LEARNED THAT BACK UP WAS ON THEIR WAY. 
01:10:23 HE ASKED THE MAN TO STOP.

01:10:30 A SHORT TIME OFFICERS ARRIVED TO TAKE THE ASSAILANT INTO CUSTODY. 
01:10:35 IT WAS LATER LEARNED THAT THE MAN HAS A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE AGAINST 
01:10:41 THE ELDERLY. 
01:10:44 WHERE AS SERGEANT BRAVERY AND TRACKING AND STOPPING THE ASSAILANT

01:59:57 WE WERE AT SOUTH SHORE, AND NOT ONLY WERE WE HAVING A BIRTHDAY WITH 
02:00:07 YOUR 200 FRIENDS BUT I DID WALK IN WHY THE FRENCH COUNCIL GENERAL WAS 
02:00:13 THERE, GIVING WHAT IS GOING ON IN FRANCE, I THOUGHT YOUR HANDS WOULD 
02:00:16 BE BUSY. 
02:00:18 AND FOUR MONTHS EARLIER IN A PODCAST THAT I HAD DONE IN MY CHICAGO 
02:00:24 STORIES WITH DR. BLABSINGER HE MENTIONED LANDING IN NORMANDI AND BATH 
02:00:33 IN BALT OF THE BULGE. 
02:00:35 AND THE COUNCIL GENERAL AT AN EVENT THAT RIGHT AFTERWARDS, THE 
02:00:41 FOLLOWING MONDAY, WANTED TO BE INTRODUCED TO DR. BLACK. 
02:00:44 AND I SAID HE'S SITTING RIGHT BEHIND YOU. 
02:00:48 AND AT DR. BLACK'S BIRTHDAY, FAST FORWARD FOUR MONTHS LATER, THEY 
02:00:53 PREVENTED WITH THE HIGHEST HONOR THE FRENCH HAVE TO GIVE. 
02:00:56 [APPLAUSE] 
02:01:04 AND THAT WAS THE LEGION AWARD, THE LEGION OF HONOR AWARD FOR SERVICE 
02:01:09 IN WWII. 
02:01:11 AND LITERALLY FROM THE BEACHES OF NORMANDIE TO CHICAGO'S BEACHES YOU 
02:01:16 HAVE NEVER LOST THE BATTLE FOR FREEDOM AND LIBERTY. 
02:01:19 AND YOU TOOK EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN EUROPE AND PREPARED YOU TO 
02:01:25 BRING THAT HOME AND FOR WHAT YOU'RE FIGHTING OVER THE POND AND MAKE 
02:01:30 SURE THAT WE IN AMERICA LIVE TO THOSE IDEALS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY 
02:01:35 THAT YOU NEVER SAW IT AS A SINGLE BATTLE BUT A CONSTANT STRUGGLE FOR 
02:01:40 IMPROVEMENT. 
02:01:42 AND I KNOW FROM THAT WITH YOUR WORK WITH ANY MOEFRMENT I KNOW FROM 
02:01:47 YOUR WORK WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA, AND I KNOW IT AS A WORK AS A RESIDENT 
02:01:56 OF THE RESIDENT OF CITY OF CHICAGO. 
02:01:58 AND IT SHOULD NOT BE LOST, BUT WE HAVE YOUNG STUDENTS HERE SITTING 
02:02:04 BEHIND ALDERMAN AUSTIN AND IF THEY SEE SOMEBODY WHO IS 100 YEARS OLD 
02:02:09 WHO HAS PUT THINKS THUMB ON THE SCALE OF HUMAN HISTORY, THE AMERICAN 
02:02:14 HISTORY, THE HISTORY OF CITY OF CHICAGO AND THE HISTORY OF AFRICAN 
02:02:18 AMERICANS IN THIS CITY IN THIS COUNTRY AND HE'S STILL GOING SFRONG

02:03:48 I AM SO INSPIRED THAT I CANNOT QUIT NOW. 
02:03:50 [APPLAUSE] 
02:04:00 AND THE LEGACY OF YOUR ANCESTORS AND MINE, CREATED A SPIRITUALITY 
02:04:12 WITHIN ME THAT WAS SUNG AS WE MOVE THROUGH SOMEBODY'S HOME AND OTHER 
02:04:21 PLACES, A BELIEF THAT DEEP IN OUR HEARTS, WE SHALL OVERCOME, WE SHALL 
02:04:27 OVERCOME SOME DAY. 
02:04:31 I BORROWED THAT FROM MY LEGACY OF YOUR ANCESTORS AND MINE. 
02:04:37 AND THEY CAN TRACK IT THROUGH THE DIFFICULTY THEY HAD TO OVERCOME FOR 
02:04:41 YOU AND I TO BE HERE. 
02:04:44 AND SO THEY HAVE THE BY DUKE ELGTON AND HIS SACRED. 
02:04:54 I BELIEVE THAT GOD PUT SUN AND MOON IN THE SKY.
