00:05:47 THE FIRST SPEAK CER MR. MARTIN FREED. 
00:05:59 >> MR. MAYOR, YOU DENIED IN THE NEED I --MEDIA THAT YOU HAVE TURNED 
00:06:06 YOUR BACK ON THE POLICE. 
00:06:07 THAT IS NOT TRUE. 
00:06:11 REFUSED BY EXPERT THAT SHOOTING A MAN THAT WAS ATTACKING A MAN WITH A 
00:06:17 BASEBALL BAT WAS UNJUSTIFIED. 
00:06:19 THIS IS EMPLOYED BY POLICE OFFICERS. 
00:06:22 BECAUSE OF THIS RULING, NO OFFICER KNOWS WHEN SHE OR HE CAN USE FORCE. 
00:06:29 IN THE WAKE OF THIS RUBLESINGER THE FOP SENT A LETTER DECLARING 
00:06:34 CLARIFICATION. 
00:06:36 IT HAS NOT BEEN RESPONDED TO. 
00:06:40 WE TAKE OFFENSE TO THIS SILENCE. 
00:06:42 IN MAKE THE RULING, COPA, THE AGENCY YOU PROVIDE HAS CONDUCTED A 
00:06:48 SECRET INVESTIGATION, RIDING THE FACT THAT IT CONDUCTED OUTSIDE OF 
00:06:52 INVESTIGATORS AND NOT SHARE THEIR FINDINGS. 
00:06:55 IS THIS THE KANGAROO COURT THAT DECIDES POLICE MISS XUKT POLICE 
00:06:59 ALLEGATIONS? 
00:07:02 SADLY IT IS, COPA IS A WITCH HUNT ON A POLICE OFFICER. 
00:07:07 JUST LAST THURSDAY AT A POLICE BOARD HEARING, YOUR CITY ATTORNEY 
00:07:16 BROUGHT FORTH A SUPPOSED POLICE OFFICER, THAT YOU AWARDED ALE MEDAL 
00:07:21 OF HONOR THAT YOU AWARDED, SHOULD NOT HAVE USED FORCE ON A PERSON 
00:07:25 WEARING GANG COLOR. 
00:07:26 YOU PUT A PRESIDENT OF POLICE FORCE WHO YOU MAY HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED ON 
00:07:32 THE BACKS OF POLICE OFFICERS. 
00:07:36 YOU'RE CORPORATION COUNCIL HAS SETTLED POLICE MISCONDUCT CASES TO THE 
00:07:40 TUNE OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. 
00:07:45 DESPITE THE FACT THAT EACH MONTH NEW EVIDENCE ARISE THAT'S THESE 
00:07:49 MISCONDUCT CLAIMS ARE OFTEN FALSE. 
00:07:51 RATHER THAN SEEK TO PROTECT THESE POLICE OFFICERS, YOUR CORPORATION 
00:07:55 COUNCIL HAS OFTEN CHOSEN TO SETTLE THESE CAYSES OUT OF COURT. 
00:08:01 AGAIN FOR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. 
00:08:03 CITY ATTORNEYS SHOULD BE FIGHT THISING CORRUPT INDUSTRY OF SUING 
00:08:08 POLICE OFFICERS NOT GIVING THEIR ALLEGED ACCUSE ING AND DEFENSE 
00:08:11 ATTORNEYS A PAY OUT. 
00:08:14 WHY DOES YOUR CORPORATION COUNCIL REFUSE TO LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE 
00:08:20 UNDERLYINGING THESE FALSE EXONERATIONS? 
00:08:23 WHY DOES YOUR CIVILIAN SITE AGENCY DO THE SAME? 
00:08:27 WHY DOES THE POLICE FORCE? 
00:08:28 THE MONEY PAID OUT ON THESE SETTLEMENTS IS OUR MONEY, IT'S OUR 
00:08:33 PENSION, IT'S INFRASTRUCTURE OF THIS CITY AND IT'S TAXPAYERS. 
00:08:39 I'LL END THERE. 
00:08:42 >> THANK YOU, MR. FREED.

00:09:07 CHICAGO. 
00:09:09 IT WAS CREATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE RECORDED UNDER FALSE 
00:09:15 PRETENSES RUSHED TO COMPLETION OUT OF FEAR THAT THE NEW PRESIDENT 
00:09:19 WOULD QUICKLY MOVE TO UNJUST FIE IT. 
00:09:27 --UNJUSTIFY IT. 
00:09:29 IT'S PROVEN BY THE FACT THAT HOW YOU NEGOTIATE WITH GROUPS LIKE BLACK 
00:09:35 LIVES MATTER WHO STAND OUT IN THIS HALL AND CAUSE CHAOS AND ACL U. 
00:09:43 YOU HAVE ALLOWED A GROUP THAT HAS CHANTED FOR THE DEATH OF POLICE 
00:09:46 OFFICERS AND DEMONSTRATION AS CROSS THE COUNTRY. 
00:09:49 A GROUP WHO INSTALLS A POLICE MURDERER THAT HIDES IN CUBA, YOU'VE 
00:09:55 GIVEN THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT AT A TABLE TO WHICH THE POLICE 
00:09:59 POLICY WILL BE NEGOTIATED.

00:10:12 INCREASE OF MURDERS. 
00:10:13 TO YOU MAYBE, THE REST OF THE CITY COUNCIL BELIEVE THAT LETTING 
00:10:19 ACL U AND BLACK LIVES MATTER SIT AT THIS TABLE WILL IMPROVE POLICE 
00:10:24 POLICY AND PUBLIC SAFE.

00:10:54 LONG SETTLE CONVICTION AND CAUTIOUSES THEM BACK INTO COURT.

00:11:03 GENERATING MORE LAWSUITS AGAINST POLICE OFFICERS THAT FURTHER ROB THE 
00:11:06 CONFIDENCE OF OUR CITY BUDGET. 
00:11:10 DESPITE YOUR OUR WELL RESEARCH OPINIONS, IT'S INCONSTITUTIONAL BODY 
00:11:16 WILL DETERMINE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

00:13:52 HOUSING, SOME OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE AND HAVE BEEN WAITING SINCE BEFORE

00:15:00 KIDS WHO HAVE GROWN-UP IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHO HAVE BEEN FORCE TODAY 
00:15:04 LIVE WITH THEIR PARENTS INSIDE OF GETTING OUT ON THEIR OWN. 
00:15:10 OTHER FRIENDS WHO HAVE LIVED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR YEARS, WHO HAVE

00:15:18 LEAVE A NEIGHBORHOOD THEY LOVE. 
00:15:21 SO MANY PEOPLE WORKING PEOPLE ARE A HEART ATTACK AWAY FROM 
00:15:26 RESTITUTION. 
00:15:30 I WANT THIS FOR THEM. 
00:15:31 I OWN MY HOME AND I WOULD BE FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT AND THE REASON IS 
00:15:37 BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AGAINST IN DEVELOPMENT IS ANTI BLACK RACISM. 
00:15:41 WE HAVE UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A MODERN HOUSING IN OUR

00:15:50 PEOPLE OF ALL INCOME LEVELS TO BE REMAIN IN AND MOVE TO AND RETURN TO

00:16:57 I STAND HERE ON BEHALF OF RESIDENTS TO DEMAND PUBLIC HEARINGS ON LEAD 
00:17:02 IN OUR WATER. 
00:17:05 WE KNOW A FEW KEY FACTS, 70% OF WATER TESTED HAVE LEAD IN THEIR 
00:17:10 DRINKING WATER. 
00:17:11 THERE ARE NO REQUIREMENT FOR CHILDREN TO BE TESTED FOR LEAD IN THEIR 
00:17:18 LIVES. 
00:17:21 AND OUT OF 1000 COUNT INS, 99 NEED TO RUN CONTINUOUSLY TO RUN OUT OF 
00:17:32 LEAD SEDIMENTS. 
00:17:35 MANY WILL BE REMOVED BECAUSE THEY'RE UNSAFE TO DRINK FROM. 
00:17:38 IT'S CRIMINAL THAT THE YEAR 2018 AS A CITY LIKE CHICAGO, THAT'S LEAD 
00:17:42 IN OUR DRINKING WATER. 
00:17:45 ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER IS A HUMAN AND RIGHT AND OUR ALDERMAN SHOULD BE 
00:17:51 ASHAMED TO HIDE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS INSTEAD OF BEING TRANSPARENT 
00:17:57 ABOUT THEIR PUBLIC'S SAFETY AND UTILITIES. 
00:18:00 WE CANNOT PLAY POLITICS FOR THE MOST VITAL RESOURCE. 
00:18:05 DIRTY POLITICS, EQUALS DIRTY WATER. 
00:18:07 IF OUR CITY COUNCIL AND MAYOR CONTINUE TO NEGLECT THE BASIC 
00:18:14 FUNDAMENTAL OF THEIR DUTIES, OUR VOICES WILL GROW LOUDER.

00:18:30 REQUIRING COMMITTEE HEARINGS REGARDING WHETHER THE CITY AND STATE 
00:18:34 HAVE VIOLATED FEDERAL WATER LAWS FROM THE RULES COMMITTEE AND OPENED

00:22:06 WHO HAVE BEEN SHUTOUT OF THIS ROOM. 
00:22:08 THEY ARE OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW. 
00:22:10 AND I'M GLAD THAT WE STARTED THIS PROCEEDING WITH AN INVOCATION 
00:22:14 BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A SCRIPTURE FROM JEREMIAH 4:16 THEY 
00:22:21 DRESSED THE WOUNDS OF MY PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE SERIES. 
00:22:25 I APPRECIATE THAT WE DID A PRAYER, BUT OUTSIDE YOU SEE WHAT IS 
00:22:29 HAPPENING IN CHICAGO FOR REAL. 
00:22:30 OUTSIDE YOU SEE THE YOUTH. 
00:22:33 YOU SEE COMMUNITIES, OUT THERE ARE BLACK AND WHITE AND ASIAN AND 
00:22:37 BROWN AND YOUNG AND OLD ALL CALLING FOR THE SAME THING RIGHT NOU. I'M 
00:22:43 ERIKA AND I'M REPRESENTING A COADDITION COMMUNITY GROUP THAT ARE 
00:22:52 FIGHTING FOR POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY AND REFORM. 
00:22:54 NO COP ACADEMY. 
00:22:57 HALF A DOES SCHOOLS WERE SHUT DOWN IN GARFIELD TO SAVE MONEY. 
00:23:02 AND IF THE CITY HAS 95 MILLION TO INVEST ON THE WEST SIDE FOR WHAT IS 
00:23:08 CALLED PUBLIC SAFETY THERE ARE 1003 OTHER WAYS TO INVEST THOSE FUNDS. 
00:23:20 1, 103 WERE HOW MANY THEY SERVED. 
00:23:27 DEFER THE VOTE INSTEAD OF GIVING THIS MONEY TO THE COP COMMUNITY. 
00:23:30 LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITY. 
00:23:33 BECAUSE WE ARE LISTENING TO YOU. 
00:23:34 AND WE WILL REMEMBER HOW YOU VOTE. 
00:23:37 JUST LIKE WE REMEMBERED ANITA ALVAREZ, IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE US. 
00:23:42 ASK ANITA. 
00:23:46 WE DEMAND THAT CPAC HAVE COMMUNITY CONTROL OVER POLICE INCLUDING 
00:23:51 HIRING, FIRING, BUDGETARY APPROVAL AND BARGAINING THE FOP CONTRACT. 
00:23:55 AND THOSE WHO FIND OUT OF FEARFUL PROPOSITION ARE ONLY DOING SO 
00:23:59 BECAUSE THEY HAVE A MIND SET THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE INCAPABLE OF 
00:24:07 SPEAKING FOR OURSELVES, AND INCAPABLE OF SAYING WHAT IS BEST FOR US. 
00:24:10 AND THAT IS NOT CORRECT. 
00:24:12 WE SAY THAT WE REFUSE ANY FOP CONTRACT THAT IS NOT PASTER OVERSIGHT 
00:24:18 AND CONTROL. 
00:24:19 THIS IS A DEMOCRACY AND THE PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE A SAY. 
00:24:26 YES, THIS WILL MEET ENDING THE CAREERS AND PAY OUTS FOR OFFICERS WHO 
00:24:33 WAS FOUND BY COPA TO HAVE UNJUST FIEABLY KILLED TWO PEOPLE LESS THAN 
00:24:38 A MILD FROM THIS PROPOEDS ACADEMY. 
00:24:41 THIS IS A SLAP IN THE FACE. 
00:24:44 WE WILL NOT HAVE BETTY JONES OR ANTONIO, THEY DID CALL FOR HELP AND 
00:24:50 WAS SHOT, AS SOON AS SHE OPENED THE DOOR. 
00:24:53 WHAT WE NEED IS ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERHAUL. 
00:24:57 WE DEMAND AN END TO CAREERS FOR COPS LIKE JASON VAN DIKE WHO CAME 
00:25:03 AROUND ANOTHER RESIDENT. 
00:25:08 >> THANK YOU, MS. NANTON. 
00:25:15 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MARY ANTON. 
00:25:22 >> MY NAME IS MARY ANTON AND I'M A HOMEOWNER IN THE 5 WARD WHO LIVED 
00:25:30 A MILE FROM THE OBAMA CENTER. 
00:25:33 I GREW UP IN ROSE LAND DURING THE PERIOD OF RAPID DEMOGRAPHIC XHAI 
00:25:39 THAT SWEPT THE SOUTHSIDE. 
00:25:40 I CAME TO THE PARK NOT LONG AFTER THE UNIVERSITY COMPLETED THE 
00:25:45 EFFORTS THAT CHANGED THE PARK AS A PASTER PATCH PARK. 
00:25:51 SIDE BY SIDE SEPARATED BY RACE EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC INQUALITY. 
00:25:56 HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT HEALING 50 YEARS OF MISTRUST AND WORK TOWARDS 
00:26:01 REINVITE EYESING A COMMUNITY. 
00:26:04 THE FRIENDS SUGGESTED THAT THE MARSHAL PLAN NEEDS A MARSHAL PLAN. 
00:26:08 BRINGING RESOURCES AND IDEAS TOGETHER TO INSPIRE ACTION AND HOPE. 
00:26:13 PRESIDENT OBAMA'S ONCE IN A LIFETIME GIFT TO CHICAGO OFFERS THIS 
00:26:21 DRIVER FOR CREATING THE PRESIDENTIAL AREA NOW A COMMUNITY OF 
00:26:26 EDUCATION AND ENGAGEMENT. 
00:26:27 SOME ARGUE THAT IT SHOULD BE CREATED IN THE--I CONTEND THAT A 
00:26:36 COMMUNITY IS BERT SERVED BY HAVING AN INSTITUTION NEAR BY RATHER THAN 
00:26:39 IN IT. 
00:26:41 WE NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL OWNERSHIP AND 
00:26:46 EQUITY INVESTMENT IN RECREATIONAL SPACE THAT'S SERVE ITS CHILDREN. 
00:26:50 NOT HOTEL ROOMS AND PARKING LOTS AND BUSINESS RELATED BUSINESSES. 
00:26:55 PROVIDES A RIM EFFECT TO THE COMMUNITY SURROUNDING IT. 
00:27:00 THERE IS ALSO CONCERN THAT THE O PC WILL DIMINISH AND DESTROY A 
00:27:08 HISTORIC PIECE OF DESIGN. 
00:27:10 IN FACT, IT'S THE MOST UNDER USED. 
00:27:12 SEVERED FROM THE REST OF THE PARK BIT ILL CONCEIVED OF A HOMESTEAD 
00:27:20 INTO A SIX-LANE HIGHWAY. 
00:27:22 THE O PC HAS TAUGHTFULLY AND RESPECTFULLY BUILT ON HOMESTEAD SITE 
00:27:28 LANGUAGE TO CREATE A MUSEUM CAMPUS WITH PARK LIKE SETH. 
00:27:33 CORNELL SIDE CONNECTS TO THE REST OF THE PARK AND CREATES FOOT PADS, 
00:27:42 DOES THE O PC BELONG IN JACKSON PARK? 
00:27:46 IN 2017, BUY GRAPHER VICTORIA WAS ASKED, WHAT WOULD ARM INSTEAD THINK 
00:27:50 OF PLACING THE O PC IN JACKSON PARK. 
00:27:54 TO QUOTE, O INSTEAD WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHT TODAY SEE THE KIND OF 
00:28:00 PRESIDENT OBAMA TURNED OUT TO BE AND WOULD HAVE LOVED TO WORK ON THE 
00:28:05 PARK HIMSELF. 
00:28:12 VISITORS AND LOCAL PROVIDING EQUITABLE FOOTING FOR ALL AND BRINGING

00:28:42 AND I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS TO COME EVER SINCE I HEARD THAT THE 
00:28:51 OBAMA CHOSE A CENTER. 
00:28:54 I FELT THAT THE SOUTHSIDE WAS NOR FOR CITY INVE. WHETHER IT WAS 
00:29:01 PLANTING FLOWERS OR EVEN IMPROVING ROAD AND TRANSPORTATION. 
00:29:04 THE NORTH SIDE ALWAYS SEEMED TO COME FIRST. 
00:29:07 IN FACT WHEN WE MOVED HAOE, THE MAPS THAT WAS HANDED TO THE TOURIST 
00:29:13 DID NOT EVEN SHOW THE SOUTHSIDE. 
00:29:18 UNFORTUNATELY, SOUTHSIDE HAS BEEN ON THE MAP SINCE OBAMA ELECTION. 
00:29:23 I VOLUNTEERED AS A TOUR GUIDE TO OFFER VISITORS A PLACE TO EXPLORE 
00:29:28 THE CITY. 
00:29:30 AS A HUNCH SPEAKING GREETER, I TAKE VISITORS FROM FRANCE WHO A DECADE

00:30:05 CULTURE AS OUR MUSEUMS IN THE PARKS WILL DEMONSTRATES. 
00:30:10 I'VE COMPLETED THE PROGRAM TO BECOME A PROGRAMMER AGAIN, I THOUGHT 
00:30:18 ABOUT CHICAGO MUSEUMS IN THE PARK HOW ONE CAN ESCAPE THE CITY 
00:30:23 CONGESTING BY ENTERING PARKS WHERE ONE CAN RELAX. 
00:30:27 THE PROPOSED DESIGN 'EM BRAIDS A NOTION OF A MUSEUM AND PARK SXEN 
00:30:33 HANSES THE IDEA WITH LANDSCAPING THAT WILL MAKE VISITORS FEEL GOOD. 
00:30:40 I THINK IT'S A BRILLIANT WAY TO HAVE A VISION THAFT PARKS PLAY IN OUR 
00:30:45 LIVES. 
00:30:47 AND YOU RECOGNIZE THROUGH THE DESIGN THAT PARKS NEED TO CHANGE TO 
00:30:52 MEET CHANGE OF SEW SIE. HE NEVER INTENDED THAT THE ROAD WOULD BECOME 
00:30:56 A SIX-LANE HOI. I WAS NOT IN CHICAGO WHEN PEOPLE CHAINED THEMSELVES 
00:31:02 TO THE TREES TO PROTEST THE PROTEST OF THIS HIGHWAY BUT I WILL 
00:31:07 VOLUNTEER TO PLANT THE TREES AND SHRUBS THAT CAN NOW BE GROWN IN THIS 
00:31:11 AREA.

00:47:14 SENSE. 
00:47:18 IT'S PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER OF DIFFERENT ORIENTATIONS. 
00:47:22 SO IT MADE PERFECT SENSE. 
00:47:27 ALDERMAN HARRIS DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB OF BRINGING ALL TYPES OF PEOPLE 
00:47:30 AND YOU MAYOR AS WELL. 
00:47:32 THIS WAS A DIFFICULT FOR SOME. 
00:47:35 AND IT WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL. 
00:47:38 BUT I'LL SAY THIS, IT'S, I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE WITH A QUOTE FROM MY 
00:47:43 FAVORITE PRESIDENT OF ALL TIMES, MR. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WHO SAYS 
00:47:58 TRUE DEMOCRACY INCLUDES COMPROMISE. 
00:48:07 >> ALDERMAN MOORE. 
00:48:10 >> I ECHO EVERYONE ABOUT OBAMA LIBRARY. 
00:48:15 I'M PASSIONATE JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IS. 
00:48:18 BUT I'M MORE PASSIONATE FOR MY CONSTITUENCE. 
00:48:22 WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS LIBRARY, THIS LIBRARY WILL BE A GREAT 
00:48:26 INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE TALK ABOUT A 175 MILLION DOLLARS, THAT IS THE 
00:48:33 PART THAT DIS XAOURJD ME. 
00:48:36 DISCOURAGED ME. 
00:48:38 NOT BRINGING THE LIBRARY. 
00:48:42 BUT WHEN WE TALK AND ASKING TAXPAYERS WHETHER IT'S COMING FROM 
00:48:47 FEDERAL STATE OR THIS GOVERNMENT ON STREETS THAT ARE NOT IN AS WORSE 
00:48:52 SHAPE AS THE STREETS IN OUR COMMUNITIES, I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THA. 
00:48:58 THIS MORNING I WAS OUT ON A STREET THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THIS 
00:49:04 ADMINISTRATION ABOUT. 
00:49:12 >> GO AHEAD, DAVID. 
00:49:13 DAVID? 
00:49:16 FINISH YOUR COMMENTS. 
00:49:19 >> SO WE TALK ABOUT THIS, AND I WAS OUT THERE BESINGER AND I HAPPEN 
00:49:24 TO BE OUT THERE TODAY WITH A SENIOR CITIZEN HAPPENED TO BE 80 YEARS 
00:49:30 OLD AND SINCE 1973 HAVE NOT HIT CURBS ON HIS STREET FROM DAMON TO 
00:49:43 SEALY AT A SCHOOL WITH DISABILITY. 
00:49:45 BUT WE CAN'T COME UP WITH A FEW THOUSAND FOR THAT. 
00:49:48 BUT YET WE CAN SAY WE'RE GOING TO FIND $175 MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS. 
00:49:53 THAT'S WHAT DISTURBS ME. 
00:49:55 SO FOR THAT SENIOR CITIZEN FOR BARBARA STEWARD, FOR JESSE STEWARD, 
00:50:02 THAT'S WHO I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT. 
00:50:03 AND I WAS HOPING WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON THIS. 
00:50:07 BUT WHEN PEOPLE CONSTANTLY IGNORE THE CONSTITUENCE AND DON'T WANT TO 
00:50:13 WORK FOR A BETTER CAUSE FOR EVERYONE FOR THIS WHOLE ENTIRE CITY, WITH 
00:50:19 THAT, I CANNOT SUPPORT IT. 
00:50:21 AS MUCH AS I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS LIBRARY. 
00:50:26 I'M ASKING FOR A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THIS, THANK YOU. 
00:50:29 >> ALDERMAN KING? 
00:50:32 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
00:50:34 I TOO RISE IN FAVOR OF THIS RESOLUTION. 
00:50:40 AND I WANT TO THANK ALDERMAN LESLIE HAIRSTON FOR HER LEADERSHIP. 
00:50:49 I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY MORE PASSIONATE ABOUT HER COMMUNITY AND HAS BEEN 
00:50:55 ADVOCATING AND BRINGING LIGHT TO THE ISSUES IN HER COMMUNITY. 
00:51:08 I WANT TO CAUTIOUS US, WE CANNOT USE THIS PROJECT AS A FANTASY FOR 
00:51:19 ALL THE ILLS IN CHICAGO. 
00:51:20 THAT'S NOT FAIR. 
00:51:22 THERE ARE SO MANY PROJECTS GOING ON THROUGHOUT THE CITY, WE HAVE TO 
00:51:26 LOOK AT IT IN CONTEXT. 
00:51:28 THERE IS A QUOTE THAT I TRY AND LIVE BY BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE LOOK FOR 
00:51:33 THINGS THAT TO BE PERFECT. 
00:51:36 WE CAN'T FORSAKE THE GOOD FOR THE EXCELLENT. 
00:51:39 WE CANNOT FORSAKE THE GREAT FOR THE EXCELLENT. 
00:51:42 THIS IS A GREAT PROJECT. 
00:51:44 I KNOW THE FOUNDATION IS COMMITTED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
00:51:51 I ALSO KNOW THAT COMMUNITY BENEFITS AGREEMENT HAS TO BE WITH THE CITY 
00:51:55 OF CHICAGO. 
00:51:57 SO THAT YOU CAN COT FIE SOME OF THAT. 
00:52:01 AND I APPRECIATE THOSE GROUPS FOR HAVING DISCUSSIONS. 
00:52:04 I APPRECIATE THE FOUNDATION FOR HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH THOSE 
00:52:07 COMMUNITY GROUPS. 
00:52:09 AND I KNOW THAT THEY WILL COME AND HELP USE THEIR INFLUENCE TO 
00:52:14 LEVERAGE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
00:52:16 I ALSO KNOW THAT THEY'RE COMMITTED TO INCLUSION IN CONTRACTS IN A WAY 
00:52:22 THAT NO OTHER MAJOR PROJECT HAS BEEN IN THE CITY IN THE CITY OF 
00:52:25 CHICAGO. 
00:52:28 AND SO, THEY'RE ALSO COMMITTED TO THE FUTURE OF CHICAGO AND THAT'S 
00:52:32 WHY THEY BUILT THEIR, THIS PROJECT AS A SHOWN BEAUTIFULLY SO THAT IT 
00:52:39 CAN BE USED BY THE YOUTH. 
00:52:40 BIT PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY. 
00:52:44 AND SO, I TOO STAND IN WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT OF THIS PROJECT BECAUSE I 
00:52:51 BELIEVE IT'S A GREAT PROJECT. 
00:52:52 IT MAY NOT BE AN EXCELLENT PROJECT BUT IT'S A GREAT PROJECT AND IT'S 
00:52:57 GREAT FOR THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
00:52:59 AGAIN, PLEASE DON'T USE THIS PROJECT TO SAY EVERYTHING THAT WE FEEL 
00:53:05 IS AN ISSUE IN CHICAGO. 
00:53:06 LET'S LOOK AT IT IN CONTEXT WITH ALL THE OTHER PRESIDENT. 
00:53:13 --OTHER PROJECTS. 
00:53:14 THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
00:53:18 >> I RISE TODAY PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS PROJECT. 
00:53:21 AND TO THANK ALDERMAN HAIRSTON FOR THE MONUMENTAL AMOUNT OF WORK 
00:53:30 THAT SHE HAS HAD TO DO. 
00:53:40 AND IT WAS A MONUMENTAL PIECE HER TO TAKE ON. 
00:53:49 I KNOW OTHER ALDERMAN HAVE BEEN PART OF THIS AND I THANK YOU. 
00:53:53 AS WE GOT ON BEING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CITY, LEARNING ABOUT THE 
00:54:00 DECREASE IN PARKLAND AND JACKSON PAFRJT THE IMPROVED TRAFFIC FLOW. 
00:54:06 LE NEW WALKING BIKE PATH THAT WILL BE PART OF THIS. NEW SPORTS FIELD. 
00:54:12 A NEW PUBLIC LIBRARY BRANCH. 
00:54:14 ON TOP OF THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL CENTER ITSELF, WHICH IS A ONCE IN A 
00:54:22 LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS CITY FOR ANY CITY TO GET THIS TYPE OF 
00:54:26 FEATURE. 
00:54:33 MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE'LL BE COMPLETING AND REOPENING THE BRIDGE 
00:54:40 IN SUPPORT OF THIS. 
00:54:43 I THINK MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAKE FRONT PROTECTION ORDINANCE, 
00:54:50 ENVISION EXACTLY THIS TYPE OF PROJECT. 
00:54:54 THIS IS WHAT WE'RE PRESERVING THE LAKE FOR. 
00:54:57 NOT FOR PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT BUT FOR AIN CONSTITUTION THAT REPRESENTS 
00:55:03 AND HONORS ONE OF OUR GREATEST PRESIDENT IN OUR COUNTRY, A SON OF 
00:55:10 CHICAGO THAT ROSE THROUGH THE PRESIDENCY AGAINST MANY ODDS. 
00:55:14 HAVING THAT IN CHICAGO, BEING ONE OF 50 OF YOU TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF 
00:55:19 THIS TODAY IS ONE OF MY PROUDEST MOMENTS AS A PUBLIC SERVANT AND AS A

00:55:35 MAYOR, THAT THE COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 
00:55:40 BENEFITS THAT WILL BE FELT BY THIS WILL BE FELT BY CURRENT RESIDENTS

00:55:47 THANK YOU. 
00:55:51 >> ALDERMAN BURKE. 
00:55:52 >> I'M PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO JOIN WITH SO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IN 
00:55:59 SUPPORTING THIS MATTER. 
00:56:01 THE CITY IS IN DEED BLESSED, WITH PRAYER AND UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. 
00:56:09 OR SOME MAY THINK OF IT AS OBLIGATION, AN OBLIGATION TO FUTURE 
00:56:16 GENERATIONS THAT NOW IS PRESENT BEFORE US. 
00:56:28 PERPETUATE THE LEGACY OF BARACK OBAMA I BELIEVE IS A RESPONSIBILITY TO 
00:56:34 UPON ALL OF US. 
00:56:37 THIS IS NO SMALL OR INSIGNIFICANT ISSUE. 
00:56:41 IT REPRESENTS AN ENORMOUS INVE.. 
00:56:44 BUT BIT SAME TOKEN, IT ESTABLISHES THE LIBRARY AND MUSEUM THAT HONORS 
00:56:49 THE POWERFUL LEGACY OF CHICAGO'S FAVORITE SON, WHO ROSE FROM A MODEST 
00:56:56 COMMUNITY ORGANIZER TO LEAD THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH. 
00:57:02 IT'S ESSENTIAL NOT ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF PROSPERITY, IT WILL ALSO 
00:57:10 BECOME A DRAMATIC INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE OF THIS GREAT CITY. 
00:57:14 IT'S FOR THIS GENERATION AND IN DEED COMING GENERATION THAT'S WE LOOK 
00:57:21 TO EDUCATE AND INSPIRE THROUGH THE LIBRARY. 
00:57:27 THIS PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY IN JACKSON PA, NEAREST LOCATION 1893 
00:57:41 WORLD'S COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION, THROUGH FUNCTION AS A HISTORIC, THE 
00:57:48 CENTER FOR RESEARCH, SCHOLARSHIP AND ONE OF THE CROWN JEWELS OF CITY 
00:57:53 TOURISMS, THAT WILL BACK ON THE WORLD TO THE FRONT DOOR. 
00:58:02 WE ALL AS CHICAGOANS ARE OPTIMIST. 
00:58:05 AND CANNOT HELP BUT BELIEVE THAT OVERTIME THE BARACK OBAMA PRSHLT 
00:58:10 LIBRARY AND MUSEUM IS DESTINED TO BECOME AN ECONOMIC INGIN FOR THE 
00:58:16 CITY OF CHICAGO AND WITH CLARITY AND PURPOSE, I BELIEVE THAT WE 
00:58:23 SHOULD JOIN IN SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON ZONING ADVANCED BY 
00:58:30 DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN OF THE 25th WARD. 
00:58:32 IT WAS A WISE PHILOSOPHER WHO ONCE SAID THAT THOSE WHO CANNOT 
00:58:39 REMEMBER THE PAST ARE CONDEMNED TO REPEAT IT. 
00:58:42 IT WAS NOT THAT LONG AGO, MR. PRESIDENT, AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, 
00:58:47 THE CITY COUNCIL, THE CHICAGO THIS H AN OPPORTUNITY TO WELCOME THE 
00:58:55 LUCAS MUSEUM WHICH WOULD HAVE BECOME A TOUR IIST MEGA A TRACTION. 
00:59:09 AS WE SPEAK, LOS ANGELES IS BREAKING GROUND FOR THAT PROJECT THAT 
00:59:13 WOULD HAVE BEEN IN CHICAGO. 
00:59:15 JUST THINK OF THOSE LEADERS IN CHICAGO MANY YEARS WOULD HAVE BEEN 
00:59:20 AGAINST THE FIELD, WOULD HAVE BEEN AGAINST THE ART INSTITUTE OF 
00:59:22 CHICAGO. 
00:59:25 WOULD HAVE BEEN AGAINST THE MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY. 
00:59:30 WOULD HAVE BEEN AGAINST THE CONSTRUCTION OF SOLDIER FIELD. 
00:59:37 JUST EMERGENCY--IMAGINE IF THOSE FEELINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BIT 
00:59:47 LEADERS OF CHICAGO IN DAYS GONE BY, WHAT WOULD WE HAVE TODAY? 
00:59:52 SO YOUR HONOR, I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT NOT ONLY TO THIS GENERATION 
00:59:58 BUT TO FUTURE GENERATIONS OF CHICAGO. 
01:00:01 THAT THIS MATTER BE APPROVED AND MOVED AHEAD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
01:00:08 AND WE SHOULD SHOW TO ALL CONCERN INCLUDING THOSE PEOPLE IN THE 
01:00:19 COMMISSION, THAT THIS MATTER HAS UNANIMOUS SUPPORT OF THE CORPORATE 
01:00:27 AUTHORITIES OF THIS GREAT CITY. 
01:00:29 THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT, IT'S BEEN A PROUD DAY IN CHICAGO. 
01:00:35 ALDERMAN BURNETT. 
01:00:38 >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:00:41 I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS. TO ME THIS IS A 
01:00:44 NO-BRAINER. 
01:00:46 I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU, THIS IS ACTUALLY A GIFT FOR THE CITY OF 
01:00:50 CHICAGO. 
01:00:52 ONE OF THE THINGS ALWAYS SAY IS AS A LATE, WE TRY NOT TO MAKE 
01:01:00 EVERYBODY HAPPY BUT WE TRY TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY. 
01:01:05 I KNOW THAT THE CITY WILL BE BERT BECAUSE OF THIS LIBRARY BUILT IN 
01:01:09 THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:01:10 WHEN WE TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE , I THINK BACK IN 1996, WE HAD THE 
01:01:19 DEMOCRATIC CONTENTION AT THE UNITED CENTER ON THE NEAR WEST SIDE. 
01:01:22 WE PUT IN A LOST INFRASTRUCTURE. 
01:01:30 PLANERS, CLEANED UP THE LOTS. 
01:01:33 A LOT OF INVESTMENTS THAT WENT IN. 
01:01:36 GU TO THAT AREA NOU, 20 YEARS LATER. 
01:01:41 BACK THEN, IT WAS SKID ROW. 
01:01:43 BACK THEN PEOPLE WERE AFRAID TO GET OUT OF THEIR CAR TO GET IN THAT 
01:01:49 COMMUNITY. 
01:01:51 TODAY, YOU CANNOT STOP PEOPLE FROM GOING INTO THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. 
01:01:56 IT'S BLOSSOMING, IT'S FULL OF INVE.S ALL KINDS OF THINGS HAPPENING 
01:01:58 THERE. 
01:02:00 THOUSANDS OF JOBS ARE BEING CREATED. 
01:02:03 THAT WAS JUST A CONVENTION. 
01:02:06 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW, A LIBRARY BEING BUILT ON THE SOUTHSIDE. 
01:02:10 AND OF COURSE I WOULD SAY, EARLIER ON IF THE FORMER PRESIDENT WOULD 
01:02:15 HAVE SPOKEN TO ME, I WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM IT WOULD BE EASIER TO DO IT 
01:02:26 IN MY WARD, I WOULD HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE. 
01:02:31 >> WE FIND THAT SHOCKING. 
01:02:33 >> BUT I DIDN'T GET THAT OPPORTUNITY. 
01:02:37 BUT I COMMEND MY COLLEAGUE I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET FOLKS TO 
01:02:40 ACCEPT. 
01:02:42 SOMETIMES FOLKS IN OUR COMMUNITY, WE ARE AFRAID OF ACCEPT. 
01:02:48 SOMETIMES IT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. 
01:02:52 WE ARE AFRAID OF THE UNKNOWN. 
01:02:54 BUT WE HAVE TO EMBRACE THE MOMENT. 
01:03:02 IF YOU DON'T CEASE THE MOMENTS LIKE THIS, YOU'LL BE LOOKING BACK. 
01:03:11 LIKE ALDERMAN BURKE SAID LOOKING BACK AT THE LUCAS CENTER. 
01:03:16 A LOT OF THINGS WE HAVE LOST BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET THAT DEVELOPMENT. 
01:03:21 WE CANNOT DO HERE TODAY. 
01:03:23 THIS IS A GREAT HISTORICAL MOE. I WAS LINSING TO SOME YOUNG PEOPLE 
01:03:27 TALK LAST NIGHT ABOUT THE PRINCESS, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRINCESS WHO 
01:03:36 JUST GOT MARRIED IN LONDON. 
01:03:38 HOW HISTORIC THAT IS. 
01:03:40 AND IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT HOW HISTORIC IT WAS WHEN BARACK OBAMA 
01:03:47 BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 
01:03:49 HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT THAT HAD ON OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. 
01:03:54 HOW MUCH IMPACT IT HAD ON AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUNG PEOPLE, NOT JUST IN 
01:04:00 THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:04:01 NOT JUST IN AMERICA BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD. 
01:04:06 THIS MAN HAS MADE AN IMPACT ALL OVER THE WORLD. 
01:04:15 GIVING PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THINK AND DREAM BIG. 
01:04:19 FOR HIM TO LEAVE A MARK FOR US IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO FOR US TO HAVE 
01:04:23 YOUNG FOLKS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLDCOM INTO THE CITY OF CHICAGO JUST 
01:04:30 TO SEE, JUST TO VISIT, JUST TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT ALL HAPPENED IN 
01:04:38 HIS PRESIDENCY, IS A TREMENDOUS THING IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:04:42 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TOURIST FOREVER. 
01:04:44 FROM HERE ON OUT. 
01:04:46 I SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WEST LOOP AREA, BECAUSE OF THE UNITED 
01:04:52 CENTER AND THE NEAR WEST SIDE AREA. 
01:04:54 I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN ON THE SOUTHSIDE. 
01:04:58 MEATER OF FACT, I WISH I OWNED PROPERTY OVER THERE RIGHT NOW MR. 
01:05:01 MAYOR. 
01:05:03 >> WE NEED TO CUT YOU OFF BEFORE YOU GET IN TROUBLE. 
01:05:07 >> I WISH MY HOME WAS OVER THERE RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE I'M GOING TELL 
01:05:12 YOU, IT'S GOING TO HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. 
01:05:20 WITH JOBS WITH INVE.S WITH BUSINESSES FOR TOURISM, NOT ONLY IS IT 
01:05:23 GOING TO BENEFIT THAT COMMUNITY BUT IT'S GOING TO BENEFIT CITY OF 
01:05:26 CHICAGO. 
01:05:27 THE MONEY THAT IS GOING TO GO INTO THE TIFZ IN THAT AREA IS GOING TO 
01:05:32 BE TREMENDOUS. 
01:05:35 FOLKS BOHR HE'D ABOUT THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE, YOUR TIPS WILL BE ABLE TO 
01:05:40 BUILDUP. 
01:05:41 THE LEVERAGE THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN FROM THIS DEVELOPMENT IS GOING 
01:05:46 TO BE TREMENDOUS FOR THE FUTURE OF CITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:05:49 WE JUST HAVE TO BE READY, TO CEASE IT, EMBRACE IT AND THEN UTILIZE IT 
01:05:56 AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. 
01:05:59 AND IF YOU NEED HELP, LEARNING HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. 
01:06:02 GIVE ME A CALL. 
01:06:04 I SUPPORT THIS 100%. 
01:06:05 AND I'M VERY PROUD TO BE HERE. 
01:06:09 AT THIS MOMENT TO BE ABLE TO VOTE ON SUCH A GREAT THING THAT IS 
01:06:14 HAPPENING HERE IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:06:15 THANK YOU. 
01:06:18 >> YOU'RE STILL NOT MOVING TO THE 27th WARD. 
01:06:23 ALDERMAN DOWELL. 
01:06:29 >> OH BOY, TO FOLLOW THE ULUSTRIOUS WALTER BURNETT. 
01:06:45 WHEN OBAMA AND MICHELLE OBAMA WENT TO WHITE HOUSE, I WAS A PROUD 
01:06:50 CHICAGOIAN AND PROUD AMERICA. 
01:06:52 AND I'M DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE OF THEIR DECISION TO BRING THEIR 
01:06:58 PRESIDENTIAL CENTER BACK TO CHICAGO. 
01:07:01 ALTHOUGH I WORKED HARD TO BRING IT TO WASHINGTON PARK WHEN WASHINGTON 
01:07:06 PARK WAS A NOUNSD. 
01:07:07 I KNEW THAT THE CITY HAD WON A PRIZE. 
01:07:12 I WANT TO COMMEND LESLIE HAIR STON AND THE OBAMA FOUNDATION FOR THEIR 
01:07:15 WORK. 
01:07:18 I KNOW THAT MANAGING A LARGE SCALE PROEJT OF THIS MAGNITUDE IS VERY 
01:07:22 DIFFICULT. 
01:07:27 EVERYBODY'S INTERESTING IS, EVERYBODY DISCUSSED SOMETHING THAT THEY 
01:07:30 WANT, THEY TRY TO SQUEEZE EVERYTHING INTO THAT ONE PROJECT AND THAT'S 
01:07:33 NOT POSSIBLE. 
01:07:58 IT PUTS A NEW FACE ON WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE COMMUNITIES SOUTH OF 
01:08:01 ROOSEVELT ROAD. 
01:08:03 I THINK IT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR JOBS AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES 
01:08:08 THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN. 
01:08:10 AND IT'S THE CENTER. 
01:08:11 IT WILL BE A CENTER FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHERE THEY CAN BE INSPIRED 
01:08:17 AND BECOME INVOLVED IN THE CIVIC LIFE OF OUR CITY. 
01:08:22 I THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO HAVE TREMENDOUS BENEFITS FOR WASHINGTON 
01:08:25 PARK. 
01:08:26 AND OTHER PARKS OF THE CITY LIKE WOOD LAWN WHERE YOU CAN BE PROACTIVE 
01:08:33 IN TAKING SOME OF OUR CITY OWNED VACANT LAND AND YOU KNOW, DOING SPIN 
01:08:40 OFF BENEFITS FROM THE OBAMA LIBRARY CENTER. 
01:08:51 THE ONE CONCERN WHICH A TALKED TO OTHERS ABOUT, HAVE BEEN ABOUT 
01:08:55 HOUSING. 
01:09:00 AND HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE RESIDENTS WHO LIVE ADJACENT TO THE 
01:09:10 CENTER AND SENIORS AND HOMES CAN LIVE OUT THEIR LIVES AND NOT FEAR 
01:09:14 THIS PROJECT. 
01:09:15 I THINK THAT WE HAVE SOME TREMENDOUS EXAMPLES IN THE CITY ALDERMAN 
01:09:22 BURNETT MENTIONED UNITED STFRMENT I THINK THAT THERE WERE EXAMPLES 
01:09:26 THAT WERE SET OVER THERE TO PROTECT PROPERTY OWNERS AND SENIORS 
01:09:31 AROUND THAT CENTER. 
01:09:32 AND I URGE THE COMMUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALDERMAN LESLIE 
01:09:42 HAIRSTON AND THE FOUNDATION OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD STABILITY FUND TO 
01:09:45 TRY TO PUT THOSE THINGS IN PLACE. 
01:09:48 OTHER THAN THAT, THE ARCHITECT IS TREMENDOUS. 
01:09:53 I LOVE THE LIGHTING FROM THE AS YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THE SOUTH, AND IT 
01:10:00 WILL BE A BEACON FOR HOPE AND FOR TOURIST AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND I AM 
01:10:11 PLANNING TO VOTE AFFIRMATIVE ON THIS PROJECT. 
01:10:12 >> THANK YOU. 
01:10:14 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:10:16 LET ME START BY SAYING THAT L.A. CAN HAVE DARTH VADER AND R-2, WE'LL 
01:10:26 TAKE MITCHEL AND BARACK EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK. 
01:10:30 THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL PROJECT. 
01:10:32 IT IS TRULY A TESTAMENT TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CHARACTER AND HOW MUCH 
01:10:37 HE CARES ABOUT CHICAGO. 
01:10:39 ALL PARTS OF THE CITY BUT THE SOUTHSIDE. 
01:10:43 THAT HE'S BRINGING THIS LIBRARY HERE TO CHICAGO. 
01:10:46 THINK ABOUT WHEN THIS CENTER IS OPEN, EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENT 
01:10:53 HAVING THE ABILITY TO GO AND VISIT THIS CENTER. 
01:10:58 THINK OF ALL THE PEOPLE CHICAGOANS FROM EVER CORNER ARE GOING TO GET 
01:11:03 A CHANCE TO GO IN THIS CENTER. 
01:11:12 I SERVED IN--LINCOLN LIBRARY IS GREAT. 
01:11:14 THIS IS GOING TO BE AN UNBELIEVABLE INSPIRATION TO PEOPLE MOVING 
01:11:20 FORWARD. 
01:11:22 THE TOURISM THAT THIS IS GOING TO BRING. 
01:11:24 THE MONEY TO THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:11:26 THIS IS GOING TO BRING AND THAT IS GOING TO BE LASTING FOR DECADES. 
01:11:31 AND THAT MONEY IS GOING TO HELP THE ECONOMY AND HELP ON THE 
01:11:36 INFRASTRUCTURE. 
01:11:37 I WANT TO STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS. 
01:11:40 I THINK THERE ARE ISSUES OVERTIME WITH HOUSING THAT THE CITY CAN DEAL 
01:11:45 WITH TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF THIS 
01:11:50 A MAZING PROJECT. 
01:11:52 BUT FOR ALL OF US WHO WERE NOT IN GRAND PARK WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS 
01:11:58 ELECTED BUT THE DAY AFTER, WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE WALKING DOWN MICHIGAN 
01:12:02 AVENUE OF EVERY BACKGROUND, EVERY RACE OF EVERY RELIGION IN A UNIFIED 
01:12:08 WAY, THIS IS WHAT THE CENTER HAS A CHANCE TO DO FOR THE CITY AND FOR 
01:12:12 THE PEOPLE THAT TAKE THE TIME TO BE THERE. 
01:12:15 I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT. 
01:12:21 >> ALDERMAN ROSATO. 
01:12:25 >> I TOO SUPPORT THE OBAMA LIBRARY. 
01:12:35 I WOULD LIKE TO SAY JOB WELL DONE TO YOU MR. PRESIDENT AND ALDERMAN 
01:12:41 LESLIE. 
01:12:42 I WANT TO OFFER MY FULL SUPPORT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL THAT 
01:12:52 YOU AND ALDERMAN HAIRSTONTON DID. 
01:12:54 >> I RISE IN SUPPORT IN SUPPORT. 
01:12:59 AND SPECIFICALLY THERE IS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THIS IS 
01:13:04 GOING TO COST THE CITY. 
01:13:05 BUT THIS SHOULD NOT BE LOOKED AT AS BEING PUT ON THE LIABILITY SIDE 
01:13:12 BUT ON THE ACCESS SIDE. 
01:13:14 THIS IS GOING TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO THE ENTIRE CITY FOR HUNDREDS OF 
01:13:20 YEARS. 
01:13:24 AS MANY AS PRESIDENT NUMBER 45, TRIES TO TEAR DOWN THE LEGACY OF 
01:13:32 PRESIDENT NUMBER 44 WHETHER IT'S WITH DACA WHETHER IT'S HEALTHCARE 
01:13:39 WHETHER IT'S WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REFORM, HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE 
01:13:46 THE FACT THAT OBAMA WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT OF THE 
01:13:50 UNITED STATES. 
01:13:51 THIS IS WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT GEORGE WASHINGTON 200 PLUS YEARS AGO, WE 
01:14:00 WILL BE TALKING ABOUT BARACK OBAMA OR HOPEFULLY I'LL BE TALKING. 
01:14:06 BUT OTHERS WILL BE TALKING ABOUT BARACK OBAMA 200 YEARS FROM NOW. 
01:14:12 I WOULD DARE TO SAY THAT EVERY SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS AFRICAN-AMERICAN 
01:14:24 FAMILY WHO EVER VISITED MEMPHIS HAS GONE TO THE LORRAINE MOTEL. 
01:14:31 EVERYONE WHO COMES TO CHICAGO WILL COME AND WANT TO BE A PART OF THE 
01:14:38 HISTORY THAT IS BARACK OBAMA. 
01:14:41 THIS WILL CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND BE A CONTINUOUS SOURCE. 
01:14:55 IT'S BIGGER THAN THE LUCAS MUSEUM. 
01:15:05 IF THERE IS A FILM WHO ARE SUPPORTED BY MILLENIANS. 
01:15:10 WHEN PEOPLE START SAYING, OH WE CAN SPEND SOME MONEY THIS WAY OR THAT 
01:15:22 BAY, AS I TELL PEOPLE WHO COME TO ME, WELL ALDERMAN YOU RESURFACES 
01:15:28 EVERY STREET AROUND ME AND WHEN YOU GOT TO MY STREET, YOU STOPPED. 
01:15:35 AND I TELL THEM THAT THE MONEY DOES RUN OUT. 
01:15:38 BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S LIKE EVERY DAY WE GO TO WORK, WE ARE LIKE THE 
01:15:45 KID THAT COMES TO THE SCHOOL WITH FIVE CUPCAKES AND 30 CLASSMATES. 
01:15:51 WE HAVE TO GIVE OUT THE FIVE CUPCAKES BUT IT'S GOING TO STOP AT 
01:15:54 SOMEBODY. 
01:16:03 AND THE MONEY THAT WE USE FOR THIS INVESTMENT FOR THE LIBRARY WILL 
01:16:10 PAY MORE DIVIDENDS THAN FIXING A POTHOLE TODAY. 
01:16:14 IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS LIBRARY THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIX MUCH MORE 
01:16:22 POTHOLES AND INFRASTRUCTURE SURROUNDING THE ENTIRE CITY THAN SPENDING 
01:16:27 MONEY TODAY FOR ONE CURVE OR ONE SIDEWALK. 
01:16:29 SO I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS. 
01:16:32 I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES TO DO SO BECAUSE THIS IS AN 
01:16:39 ASSET THAT WILL PAY DIVIDENDS LONG AFTER WE ARE GONE. 
01:16:43 >> ALDERMAN SCOTT. 
01:16:47 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:16:48 I TOO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROJECT. 
01:16:51 AS YOU KNOW AND MANY OTHERS KNOW, THAT WITH BARACK OBAMA CHOSE 
01:16:58 CHICAGO ON THE EAST SIDE. 
01:16:59 ONE WAS ON THE SOUTHSIDE AND ONE WAS ON THE 24th WARD. 
01:17:06 UNFORTUNATELY, WE WERE NOT TOLD. 
01:17:08 AND GIVING BACK TO THE WEST SIDE. 
01:17:10 WE'LL TAKE IT. 
01:17:12 WHEN THE LAWSUIT WAS FILED SEVERAL DAYS AGO, I HAD AN INFLUX OF 
01:17:20 EMAILS FROM CONSTITUENCE AND THEY SAID, IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT WE 
01:17:26 CAN GET THE PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY THAT WE HAVE. 
01:17:29 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT THE CASE. 
01:17:31 BUT THEY ARE SO VERY SUPPORTIVE. 
01:17:33 THE WEST SIDE IS SO VERY SUPPORTIVE. 
01:17:36 EVEN IF WE DON'T GET IT ON THE WEST SIDE, WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO PAY 
01:17:41 BIG DIVIDENDS FOR THE ENTIRE CITY. 
01:17:44 AND EVEN GOING TO PAY DIVIDENDS FOR THE WEST SIDE OF CHICAGO. 
01:17:48 WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COMPETE WITH THE OBAMA FOLKS AND THEY'RE 
01:17:54 COMMITTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WILL RESONATE ON THE WEST SIDE. 
01:18:00 AND RESIDENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE WEST SIDE WILL BE PART OF GETTING 
01:18:05 FROM THAT LIBRARY. 
01:18:08 SO AGAIN, WE TALK ABOUT THE TRANSFORMATIVE BENEFIT THAT THIS LIBRARY 
01:18:13 WILL BRING. 
01:18:15 AND SO THAT IS WHY I'M IN FULL SUPPORT OF THIS. 
01:18:18 AND I URGE ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES TO DO THE SAME. 
01:18:22 THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:18:28 >> PRESIDENT, I TOO STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS ZONING CHANGE. 
01:18:35 HOWEVER, INITIALLY WHEN IT WAS PROPOEDS, THE COMPOSITION OF THE TEAM 
01:18:41 GAVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF HEARTBURN. 
01:18:45 SO AS WE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE OBAMA FOUNDATION TO MAKE SURE 
01:18:50 AND REMIND THE OBAMA FOUNDATION STAFF THAT LATINO COMMUNITY SUPPORTED 
01:18:58 PRESIDENT OBAMA TWICE AND OVER 70% THAT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT 
01:19:02 OUR COMMUNITY WAS GOING TO BE PARTICIPATING IN THIS HUGE 
01:19:07 INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT. 
01:19:08 HUGE. 
01:19:10 I WANT TO CONGRATULATE ALDERMAN HAIRSTON TALKING ABOUT A CENTER OR 
01:19:20 GROCERY THAT SHE ALWAYS ADVOCATED CORE. 
01:19:22 THIS IS GOING TO BE A HUGE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE SOUTHSIDE. 
01:19:29 CURRENTLY WE HAVE 55 MILLION PEOPLE COME TO CHICAGO AND I SEE THAT 
01:19:35 THIS WILL AD TWO TO FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE INTERNATIONALLY COMING TO 
01:19:39 SEE THIS CENTER. 
01:19:41 SO WHEN WE HAD THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OBAMA FOUNDATION WE 
01:19:46 REMINDED THEM OF THE SUPPORT THAT OUR COMMUNITY PUT FAFRMENTD I 
01:19:51 REMINDED THAT IF IT WAS NOT OUR COMMUNITY WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT THE 
01:19:58 EITHER OR ROMNEY AND McCAIN INSTEAD OF THE OBAMA FOUNDATION. 
01:20:01 SO IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS, WE HAD WITH THEM, YOU GET SOME COMMITMENTS 
01:20:07 THAT HAVE TO BE VERY INCLUSION. 
01:20:11 THIS IS A BIG PROJECT FOR THE WHOLE REG XWROFNLT I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE 
01:20:16 A LOT OF LOBBYING TO DO TO GET THE PRESIDENT TO GET THAT CENTER HERE. 
01:20:22 I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK. 
01:20:24 >> THANK YOU. 
01:20:28 >> ALDERMAN REBOYRAS. 
01:20:32 >> THANK YOU. 
01:20:35 I WANT TO COMMEND ALL MY COLLEAGUES FOR WHAT EVERYONE HAS SAID. 
01:20:40 BUT THE FACT HAD, IF IT WAS NOT FOR YOU, MR. PRESIDENT, BRINGING THIS 
01:20:45 FORWARD TO YOU. 
01:20:47 IT IS A TESTAMENT FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR CHICAGO. 
01:20:52 YOUR SIGNATURE SHOULD BE IN THERE TOO. 
01:20:53 THANK YOU. 
01:20:56 >> ALDERMAN O'CONNOR. 
01:20:58 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:21:00 MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL. 
01:21:02 I DO RISE IN SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. 
01:21:06 I PRIMARY WANT TO NOTE THAT ON OCCASION WHEN YOU'RE WITH THE MAYOR OF 
01:21:12 CITY OF CHICAGO, MOST OFTEN, PREOCCUPIED BY THE MATTERS THAT PRESS US 
01:21:16 IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:21:18 BUT ON OCCASION WHEN IT GOES INTO SOME FPT TIME IN WASHINGTON AND 
01:21:25 SOME TIME WORK WITHING FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA, YOU SEE THE LIGHTS GO 
01:21:30 IN THE EYES AND SEE AN INTEREST YOU DON'T SEE ALL THE TIME. 
01:21:34 BECAUSE WHAT YOU SEE IS A REMINISCENT AT A TIME WHEN HE HAD A TIME TO 
01:21:42 WORK WITH GREAT ADMIRATION AND PARTNERSHIP WITH. 
01:21:45 SO I DID NOT WANT TO LET THIS DAY PASS. 
01:21:49 BUT ALSO CON GREAT THE MAYOR OF CITY OF MAYOR OF CHICAGO FOR HIS 
01:21:58 REALITY AND WORKING ON THIS AND PUT THISING OUT FRONT AND CENTER AND 
01:22:01 WHO DOING THE RIGHT THING. 
01:22:03 AND I DO THINK THAT IT WILL ALLOW US TO SEE THE MAYOR ASK ABOUT THOSE 
01:22:11 FUN TIMES AND THOSE TIMES A LITTLE MORE OFTEN WHICH IS A GOOD THING 
01:22:16 FOR HIS HEALTH AND OUR HEALTH. 
01:22:18 BUT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, THAT IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT WE GET TO AS A 
01:22:27 BODY DO SOMETHING THAT IS THIS RIGHT FOR THE CITY OF CHICAGO NOW FOR 
01:22:30 THE FUTURE. 
01:22:31 AND I WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS. 
01:22:37 >> ALDERMAN MITCHELL. 
01:22:39 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:22:42 FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, I'M DIRECTING THIS TO THE SOUTH, IN SUPPORT OF 
01:22:46 THIS. 
01:22:48 THREE YEARS AGO, I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WIT A PRESENTATION THAT 
01:22:55 WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE OBAMA CENTER TO A PIECE OF LAND IN MY WARD AND 
01:23:00 UNFORTUNATELY, THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. 
01:23:06 EVERYBODY I PRETTY MUCH, THIS IS A NO-BRAINER. 
01:23:09 IT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON CHICAGO AS A WHOLE. 
01:23:15 BUT I'M SELFISH BECAUSE THIS WILL BE TO THE NORTH. 
01:23:19 I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS TO THE 7th WARD AS I 
01:23:24 FIGHT TO BRING DEVELOPMENT TO THE WARD. 
01:23:25 I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE PUSH TO LET THAT HAPPEN. 
01:23:31 SO ONCE AGAIN I SUPPORT THIS 100% AND URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT. 
01:23:41 >> AS I SAID YESTERDAY, IT IS AN HONOR FOR THE LIBRARY TO COME TO 
01:23:45 CHICAGO. 
01:23:50 I THINK CHICAGOANS INCLUDING MYSELF WAS FEELING A LITTLE ENTITLED AT 
01:23:57 FIRST, BUT I'M SURE THE OTHER PLACES FELT EN TITLED TOO. 
01:24:03 BUT IT'S AN HONOR AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT THAT WAY. 
01:24:06 I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING IN COLLEGE IN ATLANTA WHEN THE JIMMY 
01:24:12 CARTER LIBRARY OPENED. 
01:24:14 AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. 
01:24:16 AND IT WAS JUST A BUILDING AT THAT TIME. 
01:24:19 BUT I HAD NEVER BEEN TO WASHINGTON DC. 
01:24:23 I WALKED INTO THAT LIBRARY, THERE WAS A REPLICA OF THE OVAL OFFICE, 
01:24:30 HIS DESK AND EVERYTHING WAS THERE AND TO THE LADIES OF COUNCIL, THE 
01:24:36 OUTFITS THAT HIS WIFE WORE, THE CHOOSE, THE DRESSES, THE PURSES. 
01:24:43 AND THAT MADE IT PRIVILEGIAL TO THE MEN. 
01:24:45 BUT IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN TO THE SMITHSONIAN AND WHEN I WALKED PASTER 
01:24:53 SMITHSONIAN I SAW PEOPLE STARING AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE 
01:24:54 STARING AT. 
01:24:57 SOY WALKED OVER TO THAT SECTION WHERE THEY WERE AND IT WAS THE HAT. 
01:25:03 ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S HAT. 
01:25:04 AND THE SPIRIT THAT WAS IN THAT LITTLE SPACE WAS PHENOMENAL. 
01:25:10 IT WAS PHENOMENAL. 
01:25:16 SO I, THE TRINKLES THAT WERE GIVEN. 
01:25:18 ALL OF THAT WILL BE THERE. 
01:25:21 AND FOR KIDS TO SEE THAT, KIDS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS, KIDS ALL OVER 
01:25:24 OUR CITY. 
01:25:28 I CANNOT EVEN EXPLAIN THE SPIRIT THAT I FELT THAT THAT BUILDING GAVE 
01:25:33 ME AS A 19 OR 20-YEAR-OLD. 
01:25:39 BUT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY SPIRITUAL, THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN SAY IT. 
01:25:45 AND AS FAR AS THE WARD IS CONCERNED, MY WARD. 
01:25:52 WHAT THAT LIBRARY IS GOING TO CHANGE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD, AND I SAID 
01:25:56 IT BEFORE, IF YOU'RE FLYING IN THE MIDWAY, YOU'VE GOT TO COME THROUGH 
01:26:02 ME TO GET TO THAT LIBRARY. 
01:26:08 MARKET ROVE, 63rd STREET, 59th STRAOED AND 55th. 
01:26:15 ONE STRAIGHT SHOT FROM RIS ROW *FROW NO BUSES. 
01:26:30 AND INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALREADY BEING DONE THERE. 
01:26:32 AND THEY'RE DOING THERE. 
01:26:34 INFRASTRUCTURE IS HAPPENING. 
01:26:38 AND IN CLOSING, I WANT TO TELL YOU, THIS WEEKEND I DID A ROAD TRIP 
01:26:44 DOWN TO GREEN CASTLE INDIANA TO A GRADUATION. 
01:26:49 AND THE PEOPLE THAT WERE WITH ME, I KNEW BY LOOKING AT THE MAP, THAT 
01:26:54 IT WAS A STRAIGHT SHOT DOWN 65. 
01:27:00 BUT WE WENT DOWN ANOTHER, AND THEN THERE WAS AN ARGUMENT WE SHOULD 
01:27:05 HAVE TOOK 65, NO ON STAR IS GOING TO TAKE US THROUGH THE BUY WAYS AND 
01:27:12 HIGHWAYS OF INDIANA, AND WE GOT TO CITY SMALL TOWN U.S.A. AND ALL THE 
01:27:17 SPECIAL PLACES TO STOP. 
01:27:19 AND THAT'S WHAT IT WILL DO FOR OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. 
01:27:22 THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO SEE, NOT JUST THE HIGHWAY AROUND, THEY WANT 
01:27:28 TO TRAVEL THROUGH CHICAGO, INGLEWOOD IS ALL OVER BUT PEOPLE WANT TO 
01:27:33 SEE WHAT IS THERE. 
01:27:34 CHICAGO LINE. 
01:27:35 THEY WANT TO SEE THAT. 
01:27:37 THEY WANT TO GO TO HIGH PARK. 
01:27:39 THEY WANT TO SEE WHERE PRESIDENT LIVED. 
01:27:41 AND IT WILL BE JUST WONDERFUL. 
01:27:44 AND I CAN FEEL IT IN MY SPIRIT RIGHT NOW. 
01:27:50 AND SO I'M IN SUPPORT, THANK YOU. 
01:27:54 >> ALDERMAN. 
01:27:55 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:27:59 I TOO RISE IN SUPPORT. 
01:28:01 I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE ALDERMAN HAIRSTON FOR JUST HER 
01:28:12 COMMITMENT TO THIS. 
01:28:17 I ALSO WANT TO CONGRATULATE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE WORKED IN BRINGING 
01:28:23 THIS VERY IMPORTANT PROJECT TO THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:28:26 SXIF LONG LEARNED THAT CHICAGO IS A WORLD CLASS CITY. 
01:28:29 MANY OF US HAVE HEARD THAT YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR. 
01:28:32 AND THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. 
01:28:35 LE YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WE SEE, OPPORTUNITIES AND WE SEE POSSIBILITY IN 
01:28:42 BUILDING THIS CITY. 
01:28:44 AND MR. MAYOR ACCOUNTSER THANK YOU SO MUCH FORESEEING POSSIBILITY. 
01:28:50 MATHEMATICIAN AND I DON'T CLAIM TO BE ONE, BUT THERE IS A FORMULA FOR 
01:28:53 MEASURING POSSIBILITY. 
01:28:54 AND THERE IS A FORMULA FOR MEASURING PROBABILITY. 
01:28:58 BUT WHAT I SEE AND THE REASON I SUPPORT THE OBAMA PRESIDENTIAL MUSEUM 
01:29:05 AND LIBRARY BEING HERE. 
01:29:07 I SEE POFNLT I SEE PROBABILITY. 
01:29:09 THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE CAN STRENGT OUR FAMILY WITH THIS PROJECT. 
01:29:14 THE POSSIBILITY THAT CRIME CAN REDUCE THROUGHOUT ENTIRE CITY BECAUSE 
01:29:17 OF THIS PROJECT. 
01:29:23 THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT WILL SEE JOB OPPORTUNITY, EDGE CASING 
01:29:26 OPPORTUNITY INXRAES. 
01:29:28 BECAUSE OF THIS PROJECT. 
01:29:30 I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT SUCCESS HAS NO BOUNDARIES. 
01:29:33 WHEN YOU LOOK AT SUCK SECTIONER YOU CAN LIVE ON THE WEST SIDE OF 
01:29:38 CHICAGO AND BE SUCCESSFUL WITH YOUR BUSINESS ON THE SOUTHSIDE. 
01:29:41 YOU CAN LIVE ON THE WEST SIDE OF CHICAGO AND HAVE YOUR FAMILY 
01:29:45 IMPACTED FOR THE BETTER BECAUSE OF A PROJECT ON THE SOUTHSIDE OF 
01:29:48 CHICAGO. 
01:29:51 SO I SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE OF POSSIBILITY AND PROBABILITY OF BUILDING 
01:29:55 A BETTER STRONGER CITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:29:57 THANK YOU AGAIN MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:30:00 >> ALDERMAN CARTER. 
01:30:03 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:30:05 THE LATINOS HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. 
01:30:15 THE FIRST IS WHAT IS ALL THE FUSS ABOUT? 
01:30:17 THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT. 
01:30:22 AND ASK WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO "SI SE PUEDE" THE PHENOMENAL SAYING BY 
01:30:41 BARACK OBAMA MEANING YES WE CAN. 
01:30:43 A LOST LATINOS MISS PRESIDENT OBAMA DEARLY. 
01:30:49 THE POINT FACT OF THE PRESIDENT THAT WE HAVE NOW. 
01:30:52 AND WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS THE PERIL OF PROSPERITY. 
01:31:02 THIS CITY IS BEING TRANSFORMED BY A LOT OF GOOD CHANGES. 
01:31:11 WE ARE TRANSFORMING THIS CITY. 
01:31:14 AND MY COLLEAGUE ALDERMAN SOLIS, YOU CAN SEE HIS DESK THAT'S A 
01:31:18 TESTAMENT FOR WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS CITY. 
01:31:21 IT'S NOT JUST HIS PROJECT. 
01:31:25 AND WHAT I DON'T SEE A LOT IS ABOUT BUILDING SKY SCRAPERS FOR 
01:31:35 MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. 
01:31:37 IN MY COMMUNITY WE KNOW ABOUT DENSITY SO WE PARTICULAR THIS 
01:31:41 TRANSFORMATION TO THE SOUTHSIDE. 
01:31:42 WE KNEW THAT THE POLITICS IN THE SOUTHSIDE WERE TOUGH WE JUST DIDN'T 
01:31:48 KNOW HOW TOUGH THEY WERE. 
01:31:51 THE SHEER SACRIFICE IS FOR THE ENTIRE CITY. 
01:31:53 THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. 
01:31:58 MY COLLEAGUES MENTIONED SO THAT BLACKS CAN TAKE PRIDE AND COME BACK. 
01:32:08 REVEREND SAID YESTERDAY, THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE HUNDREDS OF EMPTY 
01:32:13 LOTS WITH BLACK FAMILIES COMING BACK TO THE CITY. 
01:32:17 AND THIS MY FRIENDS IS A CONDUIT, AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN. 
01:32:27 SO THE CONGRATULATION TO ALDERMAN HAIRSTON AND YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:32:34 >> I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS ORDINANCE AND I WANT TO CONGRATULATE MY 
01:32:45 XLAOEG HAIRSTON AND YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:32:47 WE HEARD ABOUT THE DIFFERENT IMPACTS THAT THIS LIBRARY WILL HAVE, NOT 
01:32:53 ONLY FOR THE 5th WARD BUT FOR ALL OF CHICAGO. 
01:32:58 AND I JUST WANTED TO AD FROM MY WARD THE 11th WARD WHAT I SEE IS A 
01:33:07 GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR KIDS. 
01:33:09 THE KIDS THAT WILL GO EXPERIENCE WHAT LIFE IS LIKE IN WASHINGTON. 
01:33:14 AND WHO CAN'T AFFORD BUT THEY CAN GO TO OBAMA LIBRARY EXPERIENCE AND 
01:33:19 UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE WORLD AND REALLY TO LEARN. 
01:33:24 WE HAVE A GREAT INSTITUTION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO THAT OUR 
01:33:32 STUDENTS UTILIZE. 
01:33:34 THIS WILL BE SO MUCH GRANDER AND GLANDOUR. 
01:33:40 IT ALSO GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA AND FORMER FIRST 
01:33:46 LADY WILL DO THEIR WORK. 
01:33:49 TO HAVE A PRESIDENT BE HERE TO DO HIS WORK. 
01:33:54 AND THAT BODY OF WORK CAN BE DONE HERE IS GOING TO BE TREMENDOUS FOR 
01:33:59 OUR KIDS, FOR THE YOUTH IN CHICAGO. 
01:34:03 I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE TREMENDOUS FOR ALL OF US. 
01:34:08 IT WILL HAVE A GREAT ECONOMIC IMPACT. 
01:34:11 BUT A LONGER IMPACT ON OUR CHILDREN. 
01:34:13 THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:34:15 >> ALDERMAN BIEL. 
01:34:18 >> THANK YOU MR. PR. I JUST WANT TO PROVIDE--MY COLLEAGUES. 
01:34:28 WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. 
01:34:30 PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND, A PROEJT OF THIS MAGNITUDE GOING TO HAVE 
01:34:35 PEOPLE RUNNING BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANT A PIECE OF PIE. 
01:34:47 THTS LARGEST DEVELOPMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THIS CITY AND TO TURN YOUR 
01:34:51 BACK ON SOMETHING THAT WILL HAVE A IMPACT FROM GENERATIONS TO COME IN 
01:34:57 MY OPINION IS SHORT-SIDED WITH THAT I INVITE EVERYBODY TO VOTE YES ON 
01:35:00 THIS. 
01:35:01 THANK YOU. 
01:35:03 >> ALDERMAN MORENO. 
01:35:05 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:35:08 AS ALDERMAN BIEL I JUST WANT TO LEND MY VOICE OF SUPPORT. 
01:35:12 I WANT A PLOWED MY COLLEAGUE ALDERMAN HAIRSTON. 
01:35:17 AND THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:35:18 THERE WAS A POINT OF TIME WHEN WE THOUGHT IT HAY GO TO NEW YORK, AND 
01:35:24 I'M GLAD WE'RE NOT HAVING THAT DISCUSSION TODAY BUT THIS DISCUSSION. 
01:35:32 >> ALDERMAN SANTIAGO? 
01:35:35 >> I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS GREAT AND HISTORIC PROJECT IN THE 
01:35:39 CITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:35:42 I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID, BUT THE OBAMA LIBRARY 
01:35:49 IS GOING TO BE A HUGE PROJECT IT'S NOT ONLY GOING TO REPRESENT OUR 
01:35:53 COMMITMENT TO THE JOB THAT HE DID IN WASHINGTON. 
01:35:57 AND THIS IS HIS CITY, AND I BELIEVE THAT OVERALL IN TERMS OF THAT 
01:36:01 PARTICULAR COMMUNITY, THIS IS GOING TO BE A HUGE BOOST TO THAT 
01:36:06 COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN NEGLECTED, THAT HAS BEEN UNDER SERVED AND 
01:36:11 THIS TIME WE'RE LETTING THEM KNOW THAT YES, YOU ARE PART OF THE CITY. 
01:36:15 YOU'RE GOING TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS GREAT PROJECT. 
01:36:19 AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT AFTER THAT LIBRARY IS GOING TO BE BUILT, IT'S 
01:36:26 GOING TO BE A HUGE POSITIVE IMAGE IN TERMS OF TOURISM AND A LOST 
01:36:32 PEOPLE VISITING THAT PARTICULAR AREA. 
01:36:33 SXIK NOT WAIT UNTIL WE DO THE OFFICIAL INAUGURATION, WE'RE GOING TO 
01:36:38 HAVE GUESTS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD AND THIS IS A GREAT THING FOR THE 
01:36:41 CITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:36:43 AND I REALLY WANT TO COMMEND YOU MR. PRESIDENT FOR SUPPORTING THIS. 
01:36:52 >> ALDERMAN SOLIS TO CLOSE. 
01:36:54 >> YOU NOBODISINGER I ASKED MY COLLEAGUE ALDERMAN BURKE, YOU CANNOT 
01:37:04 SEE THE TREES FROM THE FOREST OR THE FOREST FROM THE TREES. 
01:37:10 I JUST WANT YOU TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THEY BOTH TOLD ME SOMETHING 
01:37:13 DIFFERENT. 
01:37:15 >> THEY WANT TODAY TEST YOU. 
01:37:17 >> I WANT TO TAKE THREE BASIC POINTS. 
01:37:23 NUMBER ONE, OTHER THAN MICHELLE OBAMA, THE PRESIDENT'S WIFE, I DON'T 
01:37:28 KNOW ANYONE CLOSER TO THE PRESIDENT THAN YOU MR. PRESIDENT, BECAUSE I 
01:37:32 MEAN, YOU DON'T PICK A CHIEF OF STAFF, BECAUSE YOU DON'T TRUST HIM, 
01:37:37 YOU CAN'T GET ALONG WITH HIM. 
01:37:39 SO THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE, MY FIRST POINT, HAWAII WAS AN OPTION. 
01:37:46 AND THE CITY OF CHICAGO, I'M SURE MICHELE OBAMA WAS TWISTING ARMS, 
01:37:57 AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. 
01:38:00 AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE ALDERMAN HAIRSTON. 
01:38:06 SHE DID A GREAT JOB. 
01:38:08 I THINK SHE SAID 19 MEETING I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MONTHS. 
01:38:12 AND THIS GOES TO THE PEOPLE PROTESTING. 
01:38:16 I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA IS HAPPY ABOUT THAT. 
01:38:18 HE LIKES THAT. 
01:38:21 HE LIKES THAT KIND OF DIALOGUE, CRITICAL THINKING, HOW DO WE 
01:38:26 COMPROMISE. 
01:38:29 AND THEN, THE THIRD POINT THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME IS BECAUSE, I 
01:38:36 MAY BE--MAYBE SOME PEOPLE KNOW LONGER THAN ME, BUT I FIRST MET THE 
01:38:44 PRESIDENT IN 1985 WHEN HE CAME AS A ORGANIZER AND I WAS AN ORGANIZER 
01:38:52 AT UNO AND WE WERE BOTH UNDER THE SAME UMBRELLA. 
01:38:57 AND HE HAD THIS BOERM JACKET AND HE ALWAYS WALKED WITH A SWAG. 
01:39:02 AND I MEAN, YOU CAN TELL THAT HE WAS SPECIAL. 
01:39:06 AND WHEN HE BEGAN ORGANIZING AND TRAINING OUR LEADERS, HE WAS A 
01:39:12 NATURAL IN TERMS OF TRAINING. 
01:39:14 HE ONLY STAYED THERE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. 
01:39:18 AND THEN HE WENT TO LAW SCHOOL AND MADE AN IMPACT THERE TOO. 
01:39:23 HE BECAME THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT OF HARVARD LAW REVIEW. 
01:39:42 HE GRADUATES FROM HARVARD LAW SCHOOL. 
01:39:44 YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN GO FROM YOU GRADUATE FROM HARVARD LAW SCHOOL. 
01:39:48 BY CAME HERE. 
01:39:53 AND THEN BECAME A SENATOR. 
01:39:54 AND THEN THERE WAS A RACE WHERE HE DIDN'T WIN BUT EVERYBODY HAS A 
01:39:59 RACE THAT THEY DON'T LOSE. 
01:40:01 AND THEN HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT FIRST TIME AROUND AND HE RAN. 
01:40:05 AND I TOLD THIS VERY PERSONAL STORY YESTERDAY AT THE ZONING COMMITTEE. 
01:40:09 I THINK WE LIKE TO READ TO OUR KIDS WHEN THEY'RE LITTLE KIDS. 
01:40:13 BUT AFTER A WHILE, YOU MAY BE RUN OUT OF BOOKS. 
01:40:16 SO WHEN I STARTED DOING WITH MY SON WHO I HAD AT A VERY OLD AGE, NOW 
01:40:25 17, BUT IN 2008, HE WAS 7. 
01:40:29 AFTER STORIES OF HIS GRANDMOTHERS, GRANDFATHER'S, MEXICO THIRD GRADE

01:40:52 GAVE HIM A BIGGER SENSE OF WHO I WAS IN RELATION TO BARACK OBAMA. 
01:41:01 BUT MY BOY IS TELLING ME THIS, THIS IS HISTORY. 
01:41:03 THIS IS HISTORY. 
01:41:05 I CAN IMAGINE HAMILTON AND WASHINGTON AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. 
01:41:11 AND I CAN IMAGINE WHEN PRESIDENT LINCOLN AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I WOULD 
01:41:21 DETERMINE A PHONY WHEN WE VOTED ON PASSING THE OBAMA CENTER. 
01:41:27 AND I'M SURE THAT MY DAUGHTERS AND MY GRANDKIDS AND SON, THEY'RE 
01:41:31 GOING TO BE TELLING THE SAME STORY ONCE THIS PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY 
01:41:34 COMES UP. 
01:41:35 IT'S GOING TO BE A REMINDER RIGHT THERE. 
01:41:39 SO I'M JUST GOING TO CUT IT SHORT RIGHT HERE.

01:53:11 WILSON FROST, BECAME THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE OF FINANCE IN 1976

01:53:23 AND HE WAS MY FRIEND.

01:53:32 I WAS WITH HIM AT THE FUNERAL OF GLORIA. 
01:53:37 HE WAS WITH ME AT THE FUNERAL OF EMMA. 
01:53:42 HE WAS MY ROOMMATE.

01:54:14 HEAVEN AND THAT HE WILL ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF ETERNAL LIFE THROUGH

01:54:46 >> ALDERMAN AUSTIN? 
01:54:50 ALDERMAN O'CONNOR? 
01:54:54 >> THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT. 
01:54:55 I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. 
01:55:00 I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH WILSON FROST FOR A NUMBER OF 
01:55:04 YEARS WHEN I FIRST JOINED THIS COUNCIL. 
01:55:07 AND IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I JOINED IT. 
01:55:10 SO I CANNOT TELL YOU THAT KNOW HOW NEW MEMBERS LOOK AT THE COUNCIL 
01:55:17 WHEN THEY FIRST WALK INTO THIS CHAMBER AND WHEN THEY FIRST SEE THE 
01:55:24 COUNCIL AT WORK. 
01:55:26 WHEN I JOINED I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH SOME VERY 
01:55:31 EXPERIENCED MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL, SOME REAL GENTLEMAN AND GENTLE 
01:55:39 WOMEN WHO KNEW THEIR BUSINESS AND COULD DISAGREE IN THE STRONGEST 
01:55:45 TERM BUT ALWAYS BE AGREEABLE IN THEIR INNER PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP 
01:55:48 WITH PEOPLE HERE. 
01:55:49 WILSON IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WHEN I FIRST JOINED, I LOOKED AT AND 
01:56:00 SAID I WOULD LIKE TO EMULATE HIM. 
01:56:05 A GENTLEMAN WHO'S WORD WAS ALWAYS GOOD. 
01:56:08 WHO UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS A TIME THAT WE NEED TODAY DRAW A-LINE, 
01:56:13 BUT MOST OFTEN THERE WAS TIMES THAT WE NEED TODAY JOIN TOGETHER AND 
01:56:17 FIND COMMON GROUND TO GET THINGS DONE. 
01:56:21 I APPRECIATED THE TIME THAT I HAD WORKING WITH HIM. 
01:56:28 AND I SAW HIM EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AFTER HE LEFT THE CHAMBERS. 
01:56:33 AND IF YOU KNEW HIM, HE HAD AN INFECTIOUS SMILE. 
01:56:38 BUT EVERY TIME I SAW HIM AFTER HE HAD LEFT THE CHAMBERS, THAT SMILE 
01:56:43 WAS BIGGER AND BIGGER BECAUSE HE HAD FOUND THAT THERE WAS LIFE AFTER 
01:56:47 GOVERNMENT. 
01:56:49 HE ALWAYS COMMENTED ON HOW HIS FAMILY WAS DOING. 
01:56:53 AND HE ALWAYS ASKED HOW MINE WAS. 
01:56:59 I'M HONORED TO HAVE SERVED IN THIS CHAMBER WITH HIM. 
01:57:03 HE WAS A WONDERFUL PERSON. 
01:57:04 THANK YOU. 
01:57:05 >> ALDERMAN AUSTIN? 
01:57:09 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:57:14 I AM GRAIFLT TO BE MORE THAN A SPONSOR OF THIS RESOLUTION. 
01:57:20 FOR SOMEBODY THAT MADE ME A BETTER POLITICAL INDIVIDUAL. 
01:57:25 BUT MORE THAN THAT, I'M GRATEFUL THAT I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT 
01:57:32 HIM TO SOME OF THE SOME OF THE YOUNGER ALDERMAN NOT IN AGE BUT NEWER 
01:57:38 TO THIS COUNCIL SO THEY CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE MY LOVE FOR HIM CAME 
01:57:44 FROM. 
01:57:47 FOR A MAN THAT WAS QUIET, UNTIL YOU GOT TO KNOW HIM, BUT A QUIET 
01:57:56 POWERHOUSE WHICH IS WHAT MANY HAVE CALLED HIM. 
01:58:00 AND TO THOSE YOUNG MEN THAT WERE HERE THAT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT 
01:58:06 DOWN AND TALK WITH HIM, NOW UNDERSTAND WHERE I COME FROM. 
01:58:10 I CANNOT SAY THAT I HAVE EMULATED HIM UP TO HIS QUIETNESS BECAUSE I 
01:58:22 KEEP UP MY RAUCOUS THAN HE EVER DID. 
01:58:26 BUT MY RAUCOUS ARE ALWAYS FOR THE THINGS THAT ARE RIGHT. 
01:58:29 WHICH IS WHAT HE TAUGHT US, ALWAYS LET YOUR WORD BE YOUR BOND. 
01:58:36 AND I HAVE TRIED TO LIVE UP TO THA. I KNOW THAT MANY IN OUR 
01:58:40 ORGANIZATION WILL MISS HIM DEARLY, BUT I KNOW THAT I WILL MISS HIM 
01:58:44 THE MOST BECAUSE I CAN'T CALL HIM AND SAY, WE'LL HAVE A OBAMA LIBRARY 
01:58:53 IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:58:56 TO HIS FAMILY WHO IS HERE WITH US, I'M NOT CRYING, I'M OUT OF BREATH. 
01:59:05 THIS COLD IS REALLY GETTING ME. 
01:59:07 TO HIS FAMILY WHO IS HERE WITH US, MICHAEL AND YOUR FAMILY, THE YOUNG 
01:59:21 BLOOD, THAT'S WHAT FOSTER WOULD CALL YOUNG PEOPLE. 
01:59:24 YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY IN THIS ORGANIZATION AND COUNCIL THAT LOVED 
01:59:29 AND RESPECTED HIM AS WELL. 
01:59:32 FOR THE 20-SOME ODD YEARS THAT HE HAD WITH ME, AND THE 7 YEARS THAT 
01:59:38 HE HAD WITH MY HUSBAND, MY FAMILY WILL BE FOREVER GRATEFUL. 
01:59:46 BECAUSE WE HAD A FATHER, WE HAD A GRANDFATHER THAT TAUGHT US WELL. 
01:59:53 TAUGHT US THE ART OF COMPROMISE, TAUGHT US THE ART OF AD ASKING 
02:00:01 SUBTRACTING. 
02:00:07 ALWAYS AD, NEVER SUBTRACT. 
02:00:09 SO WE'VE LEARNED THAT WELL. 
02:00:10 I'M GLAD TO BE PART OF THIS BODY AND IN THE VERY CHAIR IN WHICH HE 
02:00:15 SAT. 
02:00:18 ALTHOUGH HE SAT THEN IN THE CHAIR WHERE OUR DISTINGUISHED ALDERMAN 
02:00:29 BURKE SAT, THE ROOM FILLED WITH SO MUCH OF HIM WHEN HE WAS IN THIS 
02:00:32 CHAMBER. 
02:00:35 THEN AFTER HE LEFT AND WENT TO THE COUNTY, ANOTHER LEGACY, A LEGACY 
02:00:43 THAT I CAN NO WAY FEEL. 
02:00:47 BUT FOR THE 24 XWRAERZ THAT I HAVE BEEN HERE, I'M GRATEFUL THAT I HAD 
02:00:54 A MENTOR NAMED WILSON FROST. 
02:00:57 BECAUSE OF ALL THAT HE TAUGHT ME. 
02:00:59 I HOPE I CAN IMPART THAT ON ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL THAT IS LOOKING TO 
02:01:05 BECOME PART THF BODY. 
02:01:07 ALDERMAN BURKE ALWAYS SAY, THERE IS ALL GUS BODY BUT THEY NEVER KNOW 
02:01:15 THE LOVE THAT WE HAVE FOR SERVING IN THIS BODY. 
02:01:20 WE FIGHT EVERY DAY TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CONSTITUENCE ARE REPRESENTED 
02:01:25 HERE. 
02:01:27 WE FIGHT EVERY DAY FOR THE THINGS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT ARE RIGHT. 
02:01:32 SOME OF THOSE THINGS CAME DOWN FROM THE LEGACY OF THIS MAN AND MANY 
02:01:37 OTHERS THAT HE SERVED WITH. 
02:01:39 BUT I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT, YOU ALL MISSED OUT ON A PART OF HIM 
02:01:45 THAT I WAS BLESSED TO HAVE. 
02:01:47 AND THAT WAS WHEN MAYOR WASHINGTON WAS THE MAYOR AND HE WAS THERE 
02:01:52 WITH MAYOR WASHINGTON IN OUR OFFICE. 
02:01:57 I WOULD CHERISH THOSE DAYS. 
02:01:58 JUST AS THE DAYS THAT WE CHERISH NOW BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA. 
02:02:06 FOR A MAN THAT WE KNEW, A MAN THAT WE KNOW NOW THAT WE CAN ALWAYS 
02:02:15 CALL ON BECAUSE HE IS A CHICAGOANS. 
02:02:20 SO EVEN THOUGH MR. FROST HAD MOVED ON TO CALIFORNIA TONE JOY HIS 
02:02:23 RETIREMENT, HIS LOVE WAS STILL HERE IN CHICAGO. 
02:02:29 I'LL MISS HIM SO DEARLY. 
02:02:33 AND BEFORE I DO CRY, THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:02:38 >> ALDERMAN SAWYER? 
02:02:40 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:02:42 I TOO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. 
02:02:45 ALTHOUGH, I DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE WITH CHAIRMAN 
02:02:52 FROFRKTS I HAPPEN TO KNOW HIM AS A CHILD AS MY FATHER SERVED WITH HIM 
02:02:57 AND I HAD A NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES TO SERVE WITH HIM BOTH AS A YOUNG 
02:03:04 ADULT AND AS AN ADULT AND COUNCIL. 
02:03:07 THE MAN WAS TRULY PHENOMENAL. 
02:03:11 THAT WAS A MAN THAT SHOULD HAVE SAT IN THE SEAT THAT YOU SIT IN TODAY. 
02:03:16 THIS MAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST BLACK MAN MAYOR OF THE CHICAGO. 
02:03:24 I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. 
02:03:26 HE WAS A GENTLEMAN THAT KNEW POLITICS AND KNEW HOW IT BENEFITED HIS 
02:03:29 PEOPLE. 
02:03:32 AND HE WAS SORELY MISSED. 
02:03:35 I HAD GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH HIM ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS. 
02:03:39 AND THIS MAN WAS A MAN'S MAN BUT VERY PRACTICE. 
02:03:47 PRACTICAL GUY. 
02:03:49 ALWAYS HAD A JOKE. 
02:03:50 HE WILL BE MISS APPROXIMATED. 
02:03:52 THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:03:53 >> THANK YOU. 
02:03:55 >> ALDERMAN DAVID-MOORE. 
02:03:56 ALDERMAN CURTIS? 
02:03:59 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:04:01 I DO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. 
02:04:06 I'M MET WORKING WITH HIM AND SENATOR JONES. 
02:04:09 WAY BACK IN THE EARLY 90s, DOING PO LIT XAL WORK AND AID. 
02:04:20 YOU KNOW, HE ALWAYS LIKED TO SEE YOUNG PEOPLE WORKING IN POLITICS AND 
02:04:27 SOMETHING POLITICALLY. 
02:04:30 AND HE ALWAYS HAD WORD TO SAY. 
02:04:34 HE WILL BE GREATLY MISSED. 
02:04:37 AND GREAT DAY. 
02:04:38 THANK YOU SO MUCH, MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:04:41 >> ALDERMAN. 
02:04:43 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:04:50 GROWING UP, THE NAME WILSON FROST WAS SYNONYMOUS WITH A LOST THINGS 
02:04:58 GOING ON IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. 
02:05:00 I DID HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN AND MEET WITH HIM. 
02:05:06 EVEN THOUGH, THE WISDOM AND THE WORDS THAT HE APPLIED TO MYSELF AND 
02:05:14 SOME OF THE YOUNGER COLLEAGUES WAS A VALUE. 
02:05:16 HE TALKED ABOUT HOW SERVICE POLITICALLY AND SERVICE IN GOVERNMENT, 
02:05:21 HOW IT HELP BUILD AND SUSTAIN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY 
02:05:28 THROUGHOUT THE YEARS. 
02:05:29 HE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD BE WORKING TO BUILD MORE FOR OUR 
02:05:35 COMMUNITIES ELECTED. 
02:05:37 SO WITH HIS PASSION A BODY OF KNOWLEDGE, A BODY OF INSPIRATION PASSES 
02:05:44 ALONG WITH HIM. 
02:05:47 BUT THE WORDS MOWNSING HERE IN THIS CHAMBER, SHALL NOT BE FOR GOENT 
02:05:56 --FORGOTTEN. 
02:06:00 I WILL CONQUER WITH ALDERMAN SAWYER, HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THAT 
02:06:03 CHAIR. 
02:06:06 BUT AS THINGS HAPPEN, AND HE WAS WISE ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE 
02:06:08 SITUATION. 
02:06:09 AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE AND LEARN FROM, 
02:06:13 EXPERIENCES THAT HE HAD. 
02:06:15 SO AGAINSTINGER I WOULD RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS, GREAT MAN AND 
02:06:21 SOMEBODY THAT ALL OF US WILL EMULATE WILL MAKE THIS COUNCILMAN IN 
02:06:27 CITY A STRONGER PLACE. 
02:06:28 THANK YOU. 
02:06:32 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:06:33 I TOO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. 
02:06:38 I AGREE, I THINK THAT MY GRANDFATHER WORKED VERY CLOSE WITH MY 
02:06:44 GRANDFATHER. 
02:06:50 MY GRANDFATHER THOUGHT HE WOULD SIT IN THAT CHAIR BEFORE HIS UNTIMELY 
02:06:54 DEATH. 
02:06:57 (INAUDIBLE) 
02:07:00 WE HAVE MEMORIAL SERVICE THAT ALDERMAN CHAIRMAN AUSTIN HAD. 
02:07:07 AND ON BEHALF OF MY FAMILY, AULD AULD. 
02:07:13 (INAUDIBLE) 
02:07:16 >> ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO SPEAK? 
02:07:19 I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS RESOLUTION, FROM THE COMMUNITY AND THE CITY. 
02:07:25 ALDERMAN FROST WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR HIS COMPASSION AND HIS 
02:07:30 CONVICTION AND HIS FIGHT. 
02:07:31 AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALSO FOR SHARING HIM WITH ALL OF US. 
02:07:36 BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT AT TIMES, HE WAS IN PUBLIC. 
02:07:43 AND MORE SACRIFICE THAN ANYONE WILL EVER KNOW IS FAMILY WHEN ELECTED 
02:07:49 OFFICIALS. 
02:07:56 GU FOR ALL OF US IN PUBLIC LIEF, IS THE IMPRINT YOU MAKE IN OTHER 
02:08:01 PEOPLE'S LIVES. 
02:08:02 AND I THINK YOU'LL HAVE SOME CLOSURE, A PIECE OF MIND KNOWING THAT 
02:08:10 HIS TIME AND HIS SERVICE, WE ARE A BETTER CITY, 34rd WARD ARE BETTER, 
02:08:19 THE ENTIRE CITY IS BERT BECAUSE OF HIS TIME IN PUBLIC SERVICE FOR THE 
02:08:25 GOODNESS AND GREATNESS THAT HE DID. 
02:08:26 THANK YOU. 
02:08:30 >> CHAIRMAN BURKE.

02:18:43 GENTLEMAN THAT I COULDN'T PRONOUNCE HIS NAME WHEN I MET HIM. 
02:18:48 I SAID YOU NEED TO TEACH ME HOW TO SAY YOUR NAME JORGE, AND THAT WAS 
02:18:56 OUR INTRODUCTION. 
02:18:58 BUT JORGE, YOU HAVE TAUGHT ME ABOUT UNION, ABOUT FAIRNESS, ABOUT 
02:19:01 FAIRNESS IN UNION. 
02:19:05 HOW TO GO ABOUT DOING THINGS THAT WOULD BE BEB EFFICIENTLY NOT JUST 
02:19:09 IN MY AREA BUT THROUGHOUT THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
02:19:14 I'M GRATEFUL TO SAY NOW THAT A FRIEND OF LINE, BECAUSE I CANNOT

02:19:25 ME AND TAUGHT ME MUCH. 
02:19:27 BUT NOW THAT YOU SEE THAT YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL BOYS.

02:20:13 DESERVE THIS AND MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE. 
02:20:16 THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:20:21 >> ALDERMAN MORENO. 
02:20:23 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:20:25 I RISE TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION AND CERTAINLY WANT TO CONGRATULATE 
02:20:31 JORGE AND SAY THAT I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK AND HELP THAT HE HAD 
02:20:37 GIVEN ME ON A SAMUEL DOMPERS STATUTE, BEING THE FOIRND OF AFL AND HE 
02:20:50 WAS THERE MAKING SURE THAT WE HONORED SAMUEL. 
02:20:56 BUT I JUST WANTED AD THAT I REALLY APPRECIATED YOUR SKILLS. 
02:21:01 YOU WERE OFTEN LIKE A ORCHESTRA LEADER OF A BAND THAT WAS 
02:21:08 OCCASIONALLY PLAYING DIFFERENT SONGS. 
02:21:12 I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DID. 
02:21:16 AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE. 
02:21:17 THANK YOU. 
02:21:21 >> ALDERMAN VINEGAS? 
02:21:22 >> THANK YOU MR. PR. I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. 
02:21:29 I I REMEMBER WHEN JORGE WAS APPOINTED AND I WAS HAPPY THAT A LATINO 
02:21:41 WAS GOING TO BE RUNNING THIS. 
02:21:44 AND HISTORICALLY IT WAS NOT REPRESENT OF THAT COMMUNITY. 
02:21:47 SO AS WE SUPPORTED HIM OUT HERE IN OUR COMMUNITY, WE KNOW THAT THE 
02:21:54 WEIGHT MUST HAVE BEEN HEAVY. 
02:21:55 BUT NOT ONLY DID HE HAVE TO SUCCEED, BUT HE HAD TO SUCCEED BECAUSE HE 
02:22:00 WAS A LATINO RUNNING AN ORGANIZATION THAT SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT WAS 
02:22:06 NOT AS INCLUSIVE TO MINORITY AND WOMEN IN THE TRADES. 
02:22:10 SO AS HE CONTINUED TO SUCCEED AND WAS ABLE TO NEGOTIATE CONTRACTS ON 
02:22:15 BEHALF OF THE UNION, THEY START TODAY RECOGNIZE THAT HE HAD A LOST 
02:22:18 TALENT. 
02:22:20 WHEN I WAS LOSING TO THE RESOLUTION AND HEARING ALL THE BOARDS THAT 
02:22:24 YOU SERVED ON, IT'S A WONDER THAT YOU WERE TIRING. 
02:22:27 YOU DID A LOT OF WORK IN THE SHORT TIE. I WANTED TO STAND UP AND SAY 
02:22:35 CONGRATULATIONS FOR ALL THE HARD WORK YOU DID AND REPRESENTING THE 
02:22:38 LATINO COMMUNITY. 
02:22:39 THANK YOU.

02:23:02 BEFORE. 
02:23:05 I KNOW PEOPLE BRAGGING BEING IN THE UNION WHAT IS MORE PROUD IS A 
02:23:11 PROUD AND ACTIVE. 
02:23:15 EVERYBODY CAN CARRY A CARD BUT TO BE PROUD AND ACTIVE, THAT'S A BIG 
02:23:18 DEAL. 
02:23:21 CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR RETIREMENT. 
02:23:22 YOU'VE DONE A LOT FOR ME.

02:23:49 THANK YOU FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND GOD LESS YOU.

02:23:58 I ALSO LIKE TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. 
02:24:03 FOR MY BROTHER JORGE, WE GO WAY BACK. 
02:24:07 I REMEMBER STANDING ON THE CORNER WITH HIM ON AUGDE WAY BACK IN THE 
02:24:19 90s WHEN HE WAS JUST A COMMERCIAL POOL WORKING REPRESENTATIVE. 
02:24:26 AND WE WAS TALKING AND I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN THEY MADE HIM PRESIDENT 
02:24:32 OF THE ORGANIZATION. 
02:24:34 IT WAS JUST, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST LIKE, LIKE YOU GOT A FAMILY MEMBER 
02:24:39 WHO JUST MOVED UP. 
02:24:42 SOMEBODY WHO YOU KNOW IS IN THE TRENCHES AND WORKING HARD WHO IS 
02:24:47 DEDICATED WHO IS LOYAL. 
02:24:49 AND HE GOT REWARDED. 
02:25:02 SEEING HIM BECOME THE NE GOERK, THE COMPROMISE OR THE GO TO PERSON TO 
02:25:07 MAKE THINGS HAPPEN IN THE CITY AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE. 
02:25:12 HAS JUST BEEN, SUCH A BLESSING.

02:25:45 THIS CITY OF CHICAGO. 
02:25:46 YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF GREAT THINGS. 
02:25:49 YOUR FAMILY SHOULD BE VERY PROUD. 
02:25:51 YOUNG MENTIONER YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO YOUR DAD, HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S 
02:25:54 TALKING ABOUT. 
02:25:56 AND YOU SHOULD DO WHAT HE TELL YOU TO DO BECAUSE HE'S NOT GOING TO 
02:26:00 LEAD YOU IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. 
02:26:03 HE'S A GOOD MAN AND YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD. 
02:26:08 AND THANK YOUR WIFE FOR ALLOWING YOU TO WORK FOR ALL OF US HERE IN 
02:26:11 THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
02:26:14 CONGRATULATIONS. 
02:26:16 NOW GO MAKE A LOST MONEY.

02:26:22 >> AULD. 
02:26:24 --ALDERMAN. 
02:26:27 >> FIRST OF ALL, I PUT MY OWN NAME ON THIS. 
02:26:35 I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR RETIREMENT. 
02:26:45 ONE THING AS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE BACK OF MY MIND, IS THAT IN 2007 
02:26:52 BEFORE I BECAME ALDERMAN, WE HAD A BREAKFAST AT UNITED AND YOU CAME 
02:26:57 OVER TO ME, AND I WAS DRESSED PRETTY NICE AND I HAD REBOK SHOES, AND 
02:27:15 YOU SAID I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING HARD I CAN TELL BY YOUR CHOOSE. 
02:27:20 --SHOES. 
02:27:23 AND I WENT HOME AND TOLD MY MOTHER. 
02:27:28 I STILL WEAR SHORT SHOES BUT WHEN I WANT TO BE CUTE I PUT ON HEELS. 
02:27:34 BUT THAT STOOD IN THE BACK OF MY MIND, I HAD A LOST WORK. 
02:27:41 CONGRATULATIONS TO YOUR FAMILY. 
02:27:45 >> ALDERMAN SOLIS? 
02:27:48 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:27:50 JORGE, I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU BUT 
02:27:55 MOSTLY I WANT TO THANK YOU AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOUR SONS TO HEAR. 
02:27:58 I AM SO PROUD OF YOU. 
02:28:01 YOU ARE A MEXICAN UNION LEADER THAT KNOWS POLITICS, THAT KNOWS UNION. 
02:28:06 THAT KNOWS THE VALUE OF THE WORKING MEN AND WOMEN NOT ONLY IN OUR 
02:28:12 CITY BUT IN OUR COUNTRY. 
02:28:13 AND WHEN YOU AND I HAVE TALKED , YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR MOM AND DAD, 
02:28:20 AND YOUR MOM WAS TELLING YOU, HELPING YOU HOUT. 
02:28:26 --OUT, AND IT WAS LIKE ME TALKING TO MY MOM AND DAD. 
02:28:29 THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THING THAT YOU AND I DID, AND I THINK YOU'LL 
02:28:34 AGREE, IS THAT MY WIFE IS A TEACHER. 
02:28:37 AND SHE WORKS FOR UNO FOR A WHILE. 
02:28:42 BUT YOU BROUGHT RAN' AND SAT DOWN IN THE OFFICE AND SAID, YOU TAKE 
02:28:48 THE CREDIT. 
02:28:54 YOU UNIONIZED THOSE TEACHERS THANK YOU. 
02:28:58 WHAT ALDERMAN BURNETT SAID TO YOUR KIDS. 
02:29:01 LISTEN TO THIS GUY. 
02:29:04 LISTEN WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT HIS MOM AND DAD, THERE ARE VALUES THAT 
02:29:07 WILL BE BENEFICIAL WHEN YOU BECOME THE YOUNG MEN THAT BOTH YOUR MOM 
02:29:12 AND DAD WILL BE PROUD OF. 
02:29:14 THANK YOU. 
02:29:15 >> ALDERMAN. 
02:29:17 >> WE JOIN THIS RESOLUTION. 
02:29:23 CONGRATULATIONS JORGE. 
02:29:26 TREMENDOUS WORK AND BODY WORK. 
02:29:28 YOU MADE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT IN THIS CITY IN OUR COMMUNITY. 
02:29:36 CONGRATULATES TO MS. RAMIREZ. 
02:29:38 YOU HOLD THE COURT. 
02:29:40 WITHOUT YOU THERE IS NO JORGE RAMIREZ. 
02:29:46 SO CONGRATULATIONS. 
02:29:49 >> ALDERMAN MORENO. 
02:29:52 >> THANK YOU JORGE. 
02:29:53 I'LL BE SHORT. 
02:29:57 YOUR LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN BIG. 
02:30:01 I LOVE BOB COMING IN TO REPLACE. 
02:30:05 HE HAS BIG SHOES TO FILL. 
02:30:08 IT WAS GREAT TO MEET YOUR YOUNG CHILDREN AND KUDOS TO YOU AND YOUR 
02:30:12 WIFE. 
02:30:14 AND JUST CONGRATULATION FOR THE WORKING CLASS AND THOSE WHEN WANT TO 
02:30:17 GET IN THE WORKING CLASS IN THE CITY. 
02:30:21 THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER JORGE AND I'M PROUD TO BE ABLE TO 
02:30:25 CONGRATULATE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TODAY. 
02:30:27 THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:30:31 >> ALDERMAN. 
02:30:33 >> JORGE WE FIRST GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER IN THE FIGHT FOR BIG BOX 
02:30:38 ORDINANCE. 
02:30:39 AND WE'VE COME A LONG WAY. 
02:30:41 AND AS YOU RECALL, WE HAD ADMINISTRATION ON THE 5th FLOOR THAT DENIED 
02:30:46 THAT CITY CAN EVEN DO ITS OWN MINIMUM WAGE. 
02:30:54 AND TODAY, NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE MINIMUM WAGE BUT PAID SICK LEAVE AND A 
02:31:00 LOT OF OTHER SUCCESSES IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT. 
02:31:04 THAT'S DUE IN PART TO A MAYOR WHO IS ACCEPTANCE TO THOSE ISSUES BUT 
02:31:10 ALSO TO LARGE MEASURES, YOUR ORGANIZING SKILLS. 
02:31:14 YOUR PROGRESS MAIKT APPROACH, YOUR IDEALISM AND XWRUR FORTITUDE. 
02:31:21 AND I'VE REALLY BEEN HONORED TO WORK WITH YOU AND KNOW YOU. 
02:31:27 >> ALDERMAN. 
02:31:28 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:31:29 I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE RESOLUTION WHICH TO (INAUDIBLE). 
02:31:37 I DO WANT TO SAY I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET THROUGH YOUR 
02:31:44 PREDECESSORS AND WHEN WE FIRST MET AND EVEN TODAY, I THINK ONE THING 
02:31:51 THAT WE HAVE IN COMMON, TODAY IS COUNCIL HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT 
02:31:57 COMPROMISE AND IN THE MIDDLE. 
02:31:59 AND I HAVE ALWAYS SUSPECTED THAT WHILE WE DIDN'T AGREE ON ON, WE WERE 
02:32:05 NOT DISAGREABLE. 
02:32:07 AND I KNOW THAT OUR PATHS WILL CROSS. 
02:32:11 BUT I JUST WANTED TO REALLY, COMMEND YOU ON YOUR ABILITY TO ORGANIZE 
02:32:18 FIGHTING FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS RIGHT. 
02:32:23 AND REALLY HELP ME BECOME A BERT LEGISLATOR TOO. 
02:32:31 SO THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GOOD LUCK. 
02:32:37 >> ALDERMAN O'CONNOR. 
02:32:39 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:32:42 I TOO RISE TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. 
02:32:45 JORGE I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. 
02:32:51 WE USED TO TALK EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, NOT JUST ABOUT POLITICS BUT WE 
02:32:57 WERE BOTH HOCKEY PARENT. 
02:33:01 HE'S A HOCKEY PARENT AND HE'S A PARENT OF A GOALIE AND THAT IS THE 
02:33:06 MOST DIFFICULT JOB A PARENT CAN HAVE IS WATCHING YOUR CHILD BE THE 
02:33:13 LAST LINE OF DEFENSE IN AN IMPORTANT GAME. 
02:33:16 AND OFTEN TIMES OTHER PARENTS DON'T WANT TO SIT AROUND YOU BECAUSE 
02:33:21 THEY DON'T WANT TO MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD OR BAD THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE 
02:33:25 THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO MAKE COMMENT SXZ LEAVE TO YOU YOUR SOLITUDE AND 
02:33:30 DESPERATION. 
02:33:32 IT'S AN INTERESTING THING. 
02:33:34 BUT I WILL SAY THIS, THAT I THINK THE SKILLS THAT A PARENT WHO IS THE 
02:33:39 FATHER OF A GOALIE CAN PUT THOSE SKILLS TO WORK AS A UNION LEADER 
02:33:46 BECAUSE YOU END UP WITH PAINSER, ABLE TO BE RESERVED WHEN YOU NEED TO 
02:33:50 BE AND EXPRESSIVE WHEN YOU NEED TO BE. 
02:33:52 AND I SAW ALL OF THOSE SKILLS IN YOUR TENURE AS A LEADER OF THE UNION. 
02:34:00 I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT YOU LOOKED OUT FOR THE BEST OF THE COLLECTIVE 
02:34:03 MEMBERS WHICH IS NOT AN EASY THING TO DO IN THAT SPOT THAT USED 
02:34:08 VACANT. 
02:34:09 I WISH YOU ALL THE LUCK IN THE WORLD. 
02:34:13 AND HOPE THAT BAYEDS ON THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE USED TO HAVE, THAT 
02:34:17 YOU NEVER SAW SOMEBODY THAT AGONIZED SO MUCH AT A TIME WHEN YOU 
02:34:23 COULDN'T BE AT A GAME AND HE TO BE SOMEWHERE WHERE HIS JOB REQUIRED 
02:34:26 HIM TO BE. 
02:34:28 I'M HOPING THAT YOU HAVE A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY SO YOU DON'T MISS 
02:34:32 SO MANY GAMES. 
02:34:33 AND I WISH YOU ALL THE LUCK IN THE WORLD TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. 
02:34:39 GOING FORWARD, AND I APPLAUD WHAT YOU'RE DOING. 
02:34:41 YOU CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO WORK, WITH WORKING MEN AND WOMEN INVESTING 
02:34:48 AND FINDING WAYS TO FIND COMMUNITIES AND HELP THE MEMBERS. 
02:34:52 I THINK IT'S A GREAT FIT. 
02:34:57 >> ALDERMAN. 
02:34:58 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:35:02 GEORGE IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH YOU. 
02:35:05 I REMEMBER SEVEN YEARS AGO, THE CITY OF CHICAGO HADN'T YET TAKEN ANY 
02:35:10 POSITIONS ON ANY LABOR POLICY, OR HAD NOT PASSED ANY. 
02:35:16 AND THE LAST SEVEN YEARS, MINIMUM WAGE AND SICK LEAVE AND WAGE, AND 
02:35:21 AMONG OTHER ISSUES. 
02:35:23 AND I THINK YOU DESERVE A LOST CREDIT IN PUCKER ADVOCATES THAT 
02:35:28 ELECTED OFFICIALS AND BUSINESSES TO WORK TOGETHER. 
02:35:31 SO I ADMIRE THAT ABILITY THAT YOU HAVE. 
02:35:34 AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, I THINK WHAT I ADMIRE MOST IS THE CONSISTENT 
02:35:41 DIALOGUE THAT BEING PROWORKER IS PRO BUSINESS. 
02:35:45 AND AS YOU TRANSITION OVER TO THE CAPITOL SIDE, YOU HAVE THE ABILITY 
02:35:49 TO DEFEND PEOPLE FROM WITHIN. 
02:35:51 AND THE IDEA THAT WE CAN INVEST INFRASTRUCTURE, PEOPLE CAN MAKE A 
02:35:57 LOST MONEY AND STILL BE PRO WORKER AND SUPPORT WORKING FAMILIES. 
02:36:03 SOY URGE YOU TO TAKE THAT ADMIN AND THANKFUL THAT YOU'RE LEADING THAT 
02:36:06 CHARGE. 
02:36:07 THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT.

02:38:31 DOWN MICHIGAN AVENUE DEMANDING 8 HOURS OF WORK, 8 HOURS TO DO WHAT 
02:38:35 THEY WOULD DO WANT TO DO.

02:44:37 A LOT DIFFERENT AND I'VE BUT THROUGH THAT SEVEN-YEAR JOURNEY WE 
02:44:46 WORKED THROUGH A LOST ISSUES AND BECAME PARTNERS. 
02:44:48 I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST STARTED, THERE WERE TWO LAWSUITS HAPPENINGING

02:44:54 AND I SAT DOWN WITH YOU, AND I SAID, WE CAN DO THIS, WE CAN EITHER

02:45:28 WORKING THROUGH THE ISSUES TOGETHER.

02:46:10 SPENDING MORE THAN WE NEEDED TO HEALTHCARE. 
02:46:12 IT WAS AFFORDABLE, WE MADE THAT INVESTMENT. 
02:46:17 BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, COLLECTIVELY WE WORKED TOGETHER HAVING AN 
02:46:23 UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT IN OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM FROM PUBLIC 
02:46:26 TRANSPORTATION TO OUR ROADS TO OUR AVIATION SYSTEM. 
02:46:30 AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THAT EFFORT AS I TALK ABOUT OUR 
02:46:33 INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE.
