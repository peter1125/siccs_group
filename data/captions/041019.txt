00:02:47 >> AMEN, I THANK GOD SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I GOT TWO 
00:02:53 H WORDS HUMBLED AND HONORED. FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO GIVE A 
00:02:58 GREETING TO THE MAYOR ROM EMANUEL AND ALL THE CITY COUNCIL 
00:03:04 MEMBERS AND I THANK YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE AND OPPORTUNITY TO 
00:03:06 STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY. I COME NOW WITH A WORD I BELIEVE THAT 
00:03:11 WAS GIVEN TO ME AND WHAT I'M FITTING TO DO IS TAKE YOU IN THE 
00:03:16 THROWN ROOM WITH ME. I THINK IF WE GO AS A UNIT AND WE GO IN 
00:03:20 UNITY THEN OUR VOICES WILL BE HEARD EVEN LOUDER. AS I RAN 
00:03:25 ACROSS A STORY IN THE BIBLE ABOUT THE TOWER OF ABLE AND A LOT 
00:03:29 OF YOU MAY KNOW ABOUT IT AND IN THE STORY THEY ALL SPOKE THE 
00:03:33 SAME LANGUAGE. COMMON SPEECH AND THEY MADE A DECISION THAT 
00:03:37 THEY WANTED TO DO SOMETHING. IT WAS A GREAT DECISION BUT IT 
00:03:41 WAS THEIR HEART A LITTLE MESSED UP THAT MADE GOD COME AND 
00:03:47 DECIDE HE'S GOING TO CHANGE THE DECISION SO WHAT GOD SHOWED ME 
00:03:50 IN THE STORY IS THE VALUE OF UNITY. THE POWER OF UNITY WHEN 
00:03:55 WE ARE ALL TOGETHER AND WE ARE ALL SPEAKING THAT ONE LANGUAGE 
00:04:01 AND ALL COMING FOR ONE PURPOSE AND WE KNOW NAT PURPOSE IS THE 
00:04:04 CITY OF CHICAGO. AND SO THAT'S WHERE I WISH MY PRAYER TO GO. 
00:04:08 ONCE AGAIN I BLESS GOD YOU ALL AND ASK THAT YOU ALL BE PATIENT 
00:04:12 WITH ME AS I GET READY TO GO TO THE THROWN. WOULD EVERYONE 
00:04:16 PLEASE GO TO THE THROWN WITH ME? FATHER IN HEAVENS, IT IS IN

00:07:12 >> PUBLIC COMMENT. 
00:07:13 >> THE COUNCIL WILL BEGIN PUBLIC COMMENT LIMITED TO 30 
00:07:16 MINUTES. EACH LIMITED TO 3 MINUTES. ANY COMMENTS ARE 
00:07:23 AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW AT THE CITY CLERK STAFF. THIS IS FOR 
00:07:27 COMMENTS AND NOT QUESTIONS. THE FIRST SPEAKER IS MS CRYSTAL 
00:07:32 PETERS. 
00:07:35 >> CITY COUNCIL AND EVERYONE HERE. I AM HERE IN 
00:07:42 REPRESENTATION OF INGLEWOOD AND THE OVER-SATURATION OF LIQUOR 
00:07:49 STORES IN MY COMMUNITY. IT'S NO YOU KNOW, SECRET. IT'S NOT 
00:07:57 HIDDEN. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT ANYONE WHO'S ROAD THROUGH 
00:08:03 INGLEWOOD OR CAMPAIGNED IN INGLEWOOD OR DID ANYTHING IN 
00:08:09 INGLEWOOD HAS NOT NOTICED. INGLEWOOD IS GHETTO AND CALLED 
00:08:15 IMPOVERISHED. MOST ARE EDUCATED, DISENFRANCHISED AND LOW 
00:08:22 INCOME, RIGHT? WHY DO WE HAVE SO MANY LIQUOR STORES? IT 
00:08:25 DOESN'T SEEM LIKE LIQUOR STORES WOULD HELP US GHETTO PEOPLE 
00:08:30 IMPOVERISHED UNEDUCATED PEOPLE, DISENFRANCHISED AND LOW INCOME 
00:08:37 PEOPLE. I HAVE POLLED THE PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY SAYING I'M 
00:08:41 SO TIRED OF SEEING LIQUOR STORES AND ASK WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE 
00:08:46 TO SEE AND THESE ARE THE THINGS THE PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY 
00:08:52 WOULD LIKE TO SEE OPPOSED TO LIQUOR STORES. HOW ABOUT AQUATIC 
00:08:57 CENTER? WE DON'T HAVE AQUATIC CENTER. I BELIEVE I WAS IN 
00:09:03 WHEATEN AND THEY HAVE A BEAUTIFUL AQUATIC CENTER. LIQUOR 
00:09:09 STORES TAKE UP PROPERTY WHICH CAN BE USED FOR AN AQUATIC 
00:09:15 CENTER. I HOPE YOU WOULD AGREE. I BELIEVE WE ARE PRAYED UPON 
00:09:18 IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THESE LIQUOR STORES AND I'M NO 
00:09:23 STATISTICAL PERSON AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WORKS AND HOW 
00:09:27 THEY ARE ABLE TO JUST COME AND PUT LIQUOR STORES THERE, BUT 
00:09:32 ONE THING I DO KNOW IS WE ARE NOT NOTIFIED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD 
00:09:37 THAT OH, ON TOP OF THE 20 LIQUOR STORES YOU HAVE, HERE'S 21 
00:09:43 LIQUOR STORE. DO WE HAVE A SAY? I JUST LEARNED WE DO, AND 
00:09:47 THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY PLEADING WITH YOU CITY COUNCIL TO 
00:09:52 LOOK INTO THIS PROBLEM AND HELP FIX IT. LIQUOR STORES OVER 
00:09:59 SATURATION OF LIQUOR STORES PROMOTES MORE ON TOP OF GUN AND 
00:10:05 GANG VIOLENCE THAT WE HAVE, NOW LIQUOR STORE BRINGS LIQUOR 
00:10:12 ABUSE, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ABUSE AND IT IS A CRYING SHAME. 
00:10:18 OTHER THINGS THAT THE COMMUNITY ASKS FOR INSTEAD OF LIQUOR 
00:10:22 STORES, HOW ABOUT REAL GROCERY STORES THAT OFFER BETTER AND 
00:10:27 HEALTHIER FOOD FOR OUR COMMUNITY? MAYBE A REC CENTER. YOU 
00:10:32 KNOW? WITH A SPORT AVAILABLE FOR OUR CHILDREN TO PLAY AND 
00:10:37 LEARN. 
00:10:39 >> THANK YOU. THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] 
00:10:48 >> SO, CONGRESSMAN RUSH HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS THE LAST COUPLE 
00:10:53 WEEKS MAKING VILE AND IGNORANT COMMENTS AND CALLING THE FOP 
00:10:57 THE PUBLIC ENEMY OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY. NOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
00:11:04 SAYS THERE IS A EMERGENCY AT THE BOARDER AND YOU ALL LOSE YOUR 
00:11:08 MIND AND TAKE A STREET SIGN DOWN, TRUMP FREE ZONE. HOW MUCH 
00:11:14 MERE RACIST AND DIVISIVE CAN SOMEONE BE THEN THE COMMENTS OUT 
00:11:20 OF BOBBY RUSHES MOUTH. TO VOTE FOR LAURA [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] 
00:11:25 HAVE BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS. YOU CAN'T PAY ATTENTION THE LAST 
00:11:29 MEETING YOU DON'TS CARE AND WONDER WHY YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVE. 
00:11:32 TERRIBLE. NOT A SINGLE-ALDERMAN HAS SAID A WORD ABOUT THE 
00:11:37 IGNORANT COMMENTS BOBBY RUSH SAID. I DIDN'T HEAR A SINGLE 
00:11:42 THING. FACEBOOK. GET IN FRONT OF THE MICROPHONE. YOU KNOW 
00:11:47 HOW TO DO IT WHEN YOU WANT SOMETHING, RIGHT? LINCOLN YARDS, 
00:11:51 NOW I'M AGAINST IT FOR A TOTALLY DIFFERENT REASON THEN MOST 
00:11:55 PEOPLE HERE. Y'ALL THINK IT'S OKAY TO FINE $2 BILLION IN TIFF 
00:12:02 FUNDS TO MAKE THE MAYOR AND FRIENDS RICHER THEN THEY ALREADY 
00:12:06 ARE WHEN YOU GOT A PENSION CRISIS THAT MANY HAVE BEEN HERE 
00:12:10 DECADES AND DONE NOTHING ABOUT BUT MAKE IT WORSE. PENSION 
00:12:16 DIDN'T COME ABOUT BECAUSE POLICEMAN ARE NOT PAYING THEIR FAIR 
00:12:21 SHARE. IT IS THIS COUNCIL THAT LET THE MONEY NOT TO BE PAID. 
00:12:28 DID IT DECADES. YOU ALL LOOKED THE OTHER WAY AND HAVEN'T SAID 
00:12:31 A WORD ABOUT IT. LIGHTFOOT IS SAYING SHE IS GOING TO SOLVE 
00:12:39 IT. NOW SHE IS THREATENING ALDERMAN BURKE TO IMPEDE THE 
00:12:45 PROGRESS. SHE GOT 17 PERCENT OF THE VOTE. START DOING YOUR 
00:12:51 JOB. EARN THE PENSION FOR 10 YEARS OF SERVICE. YOU MAKE THE 
00:12:54 LAWS NOT THE MAYOR. HE'S NOT A EMPEROR AND SHE'S NOT A 
00:13:02 EMPRESS. IT TAKES 26 VOTES TO GET IT PASSED. DO SOMETHING 
00:13:06 ABOUT IT. REALLY. AND THE PENSION, THAT IS ONLY PART OF THE 
00:13:09 PROBLEM. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT YOU LIKE TO STAND IN FRONT OF 
00:13:12 MICROPHONES AND SHED A TEAR WHEN THERE WAS A POLICE FUNERAL, 
00:13:16 LIKE YOU CARE, YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING TO NEGOTIATE A 
00:13:19 CONTRACT. YOU ARE DISINTERESTED IN THE POLICE CONTRACT AS YOU 
00:13:23 ARE IN PUBLIC COMMENTS. YOU COULD CARE LESS. YOU COULD HAVE 
00:13:27 SOLVED THIS A LONG TIME AGO. YOU NEVER HOLD FEET TO THE FIRE. 
00:13:30 YOU SIT AND DO NOTHING AND LET THE MAYOR DICTATE HOW YOU DO 
00:13:34 AND HOW YOU VOTE. VERY FEW HAVE A BACKBONE. IT IS A NEW 
00:13:38 MAYOR AND SUPPOSED TO BE A NEW TERM, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND 
00:13:41 DON'T LET Lightfoot RUSH OUT. IT NEEDS TO STOP. START 
00:13:51 EARNING YOU MONEY. 
00:13:52 >> THANK YOU, THE NEXT SPEAKER IS [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] 
00:13:54 >> THANK YOU ALL FOR GIVING YOUR ATTENTION THIS MORNING. I 
00:13:59 APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTIVENESS AS I COME TO SPEAK ABOUT 
00:14:06 OVER-SATURATION WITHIN THE INGLEWOOD COMMUNITY SPECIFICALLY 
00:14:08 THE 16TH AND 6TH WARD. I LIKE TO ADDRESS POLICING PRACTICE 
00:14:14 WHICH I THINK YOU SHOULD CONSIDER LATER. OVER-SATURATION OF 
00:14:18 LIQUOR STORES IN THE COMMUNITY ARE LEADING TO REALLY REALLY 
00:14:22 TERRIBLE CONDITIONS WITHIN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THERE SEEMS TO 
00:14:26 BE AN INVESTMENT WITHIN THESE LIQUOR STORES AND CONTINUATION 
00:14:32 OF PERMITTING THE LIQUOR STORES TO EXIST THAT IS BEYOND ME. 
00:14:36 ON OUR SIDE OF THE I'LL 
00:17:10 >> I'M NOT ADDRESSING THE POLITICAL HACKS HERE. I'M TALKING 
00:17:14 TO THE PEOPLE. YOU HAD A CHANCE IN FEBRUARY TO MAKE A 
00:17:22 DIFFERENCE, YOU DID NOT. 42 OF THEM ARE BACK, BUT YOU WON'T 
00:17:29 CHANGE. I WANT YOU ALL TO CHANGE. LET YOUR LIGHT SHINE. YOU 
00:17:36 CAN'T CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME THING YOU GET THE SAME RESULT. 
00:17:41 I HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE POLITICAL HACKS HERE. EACH 
00:17:51 OF YOU HAVE A LIGHT. GOING ON IN CHICAGO. WHAT IS GOING ON 
00:18:09 HERE? IF YOU ARE NOT INFORMED ENGAGED AND ENLIGHTENED. YOU 
00:18:16 HAVE [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] IT IS A HUNDRED YEARS OF CORRUPTION 
00:18:27 HERE. HOW DO YOU EXPECT MS Lightfoot TO CLEAN IT UP? YOU LET 
00:18:39 YOUR LIGHT SHINE. SHINE ON THE CORRUPTION THAT IS HERE. LET 
00:20:01 YOUR LIGHT SHINE. YOU ARE THE CAUSE OF IT. YOU HAVE BEEN 
00:20:05 ABLE TO [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS]

00:21:22 [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] WE HAVE PREDICTABLE SCHEDULES AND THE 
00:21:25 BOSSES CAN NOT FORCE TO WORK LAST MINUTE SHIFTS. WE HAVE JOB 
00:21:29 SECURITY AND PROTECTION AGAINST HAVING THE JOBS CONTRACTED 
00:21:33 OUT. THAT MEANS WE LIKE OUR JOBS. WE WANT TO KEEP OUR JOBS

00:21:54 COVERING STATIONS IN EVERY WARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
00:21:57 >> THANK YOU. THE NEXT SPEAKER IS RANDY JACOBSON. 
00:22:06 >> HONORABLE COUNCIL MEMBER, WHEN THIS TIFF IS DELAYED AND THE 
00:22:10 DEAL IS RENEGOTIATED THE QUESTION OF HOW TAX INCREMENTS ARE 
00:22:14 PRIORITIZED WILL BE ON THE TABLE. THE PARK WILL BE FUNDED. 
00:22:19 STERLING BAY WILL PAY FAIR SHARE THE COST AND WHAT WILL BE 
00:22:24 FUNDED AND WHAT ORDER IT WILL BE BUILT CAN BE REPRIORITIZED TO 
00:22:31 PROMOTE SOUND PRINCIPLES. ASSERTION THERE IS LESS CONGESTION 
00:22:44 ISN'T REALTY. THESE ARE BASED ON A FLAWED TRAFFIC REPORT THAT 
00:22:49 USE 12.8 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF DEVELOPMENT AND MASTER PLAN AS 
00:22:53 IT IS BASELINE INSTEAD OF THE POTENTIAL 22-23 ALLOWED BY 
00:23:03 ZONING DENSITY BONUS. THE ONLY WAY TO REDUCE TRAFFIC 
00:23:12 CONGESTION IS BRING INTO ALIGN BY REDUCING THE SCALE OF THE 
00:23:15 DEVELOPMENT AND USING THE TAX INCREMENTS ON NEW TRANSIT 
00:23:21 CONNECTION THAT GET COMMUTERS OUT OF THE CAR AND OFF GRID 
00:23:25 LOCKED STREETS. THE PUBLIC DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY $150 MILLION 
00:23:29 FOR A DOMINIC STREET BRIDGE THAT COLLECTS LINCOLN YARD NORTH 
00:23:35 WITH LINCOLN YARD SOUTH WHEN WHAT WE NEED IS TRANSIT THAT 
00:23:39 CONNECT VACENT LAND ON THE NORTH SIDE TO THE SOUTH AND WEST 
00:23:43 SIDE. WHY DOES STERLING BAY WANT TO BUILD A CUT THROUGH 
00:23:54 STREET DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAMPUS? IT IS A BACKWARD FAILED 
00:23:57 PLANNING MODEL TAXPAYERS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR. WHY 
00:24:02 SHOULD CHICAGO PAY FOR STREETS AND BRIDGES DESIGNED TO CONNECT 
00:24:07 JOBS IN CHICAGO TO THE SUBURBS? LET'S KEEP WORKERS PROPERTY 
00:24:11 TAX CIRCULATING IN CHICAGO BY CONNECTING OUT LYING DISINVESTED 
00:24:20 NEIGHBORHOODS WITH THE NEW JOB CENTER IN THE EXPANDING LOOP? 
00:24:23 THE BILLIONS ALLOCATED IN IT TIFF CAN BE USE TO STIFF CHICAGO 
00:24:32 TOGETHER. PUBLIC RESPONDING SHOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO MOVE 
00:24:35 AROUND INSIDE THE CITY NOT MAKE IT EASIER TO GET OUT OF THE 
00:24:38 CITY. INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDED BY THE TIFF SHOULD BE 
00:24:45 REPRIORITIZED TO BENEFIT CHICAGO. THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
00:24:51 GENERATED BY LOOP EXPANSION PROJECT BY LINCOLN YARD AND 7 
00:24:58 OTHER MULTIPLE MARKET AND BENEFIT ALL CHICAGO. REFORM STARTS 
00:25:02 NOW RIGHT HIRE WITH THIS VOTE AND YOU CAN BUT A WIND AT THE 
00:25:06 BACK OF THE NEW MAYOR OR STEP ON HER- 
00:25:09 >> THANK YOU. THE NEXT SPEAKER IS DARNELL HORTON. GOOD 
00:25:18 MORNING CITY COUNCIL. LIFE LONG RESIDENT FROM NORTH LAWNDALE 
00:25:23 AND A EMPLOYEE FOR DIVVY. YOU ARE-LOOKING AT A SECOND CHANCE 
00:25:28 PERSON HERE 4 YEARS INTO MY JOB WITH DIVVY NOW. WHEN I CAME 
00:25:33 IN I DIDN'T KNOW NONE OF THE SKILLS BUT WAS TAUGHT THE SKILLS 
00:25:41 4 YEARS I HAVE BEEN THERE. DIVVY IS GOOD PROGRAM TO ME AS 
00:25:48 WELL AS THE GUYS THAT COME IN. WE HAVE VETERANS THAT LOOK 
00:25:52 LIKE ME THAT WORK THERE. WE HAVE YOUNG KIDS THAT WE BRING IN 
00:25:57 OVER THE SUMMER THAT WORK WITH US. DIVVY HAS BEEN GOOD TO THE 
00:26:02 NEIGHBORHOOD, SOUTH AND WEST SIDE AS WELL. I DO A LOT OF ROCK 
00:26:06 CLUB PARTIES, SO IT IS MORE LIKE WHEN WE HAVE THE BLOCK CLUB 
00:26:10 PARTIES IT IS MORE OF A THEME I WANT TO SHOW THE YOUNGSTERS 
00:26:16 OUTSIDE WHAT THEY SEE DOWNTOWN BUT WE HAVE BAKE STATIONS WEST 
00:26:19 AND SOUTH, WE JUST DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH BUT WITH THE NEW 
00:26:26 CONTRACT WE CAN SERVE EVERY COMMUNITY AND ASK COUNCIL DO THAT. 
00:26:29 I REALLY INSPIRE YOU GUYS TO LOOK AT YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND 
00:26:32 LOOK WHAT DIVVY HAS DONE TO YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS, THE ONES THAT 
00:26:35 DO HAVE BIKES AND WE PUTTING THEM IN YOUR COMMUNITY TODAY IT 
00:26:39 WOULD MAKE IT A LOT BETTER JUST FOR THE KIDS TO SEE WE CARE. 
00:26:43 IF WE CARE THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO EXPAND WHAT WE GOT. MY 
00:26:50 MOM SAID IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT. WE ARE BRINGING NEW 
00:26:55 THINGS WITH THE COMMUNITY AND HAVE A TRAINING CENTER FOR THE 
00:26:58 GUYS AND GIRLS, AND IT IS A DIVERSE COMPANY. YOU SEE EVERY 
00:27:02 COLOR THAT WORKS THERE. EVERYBODY MOVES UP WHEN THEY WANT TO. 
00:27:08 IT IS ON THE PEOPLE THAT WORK THERE IF THEY WANT TO GO FARTHER 
00:27:12 AND I CHOSE TO GO FARTHER. I'M NERVOUS BUT THIS IS IS THE 
00:27:18 TRUTH. I DON'T TRY TO READ A SCRIPT TO YOU GUYS. THIS IS 
00:27:22 SOMETHING I SEE DIVVY IS HELPING IN OUR COMMUNITY WITH ALL THE 
00:27:26 COMMUNITIES. WITH THE JOB I HAVE I TOUCH 635 STATIONS A MONTH 
00:27:31 BY MYSELF BUT DO IT BECAUSE I GOT THE TRAINING FOR AND 
00:27:36 DETERMINATION IS WHAT YOU NEED THESE DAYS AND I DETERMINED TO 
00:27:40 SEE THAT DIVVY GIVES MERE TO THE CITY. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE 
00:27:47 TODAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I GOT SOME LEFT. I'LL GIVE 
00:27:50 IT TO THE NEXT PERSON. 
00:27:52 >> THANK YOU. THE NEXT SPEAKER IS RONALD JACKSON. 
00:28:05 >> GOOD MORNING. I AM HERE TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH. I AM 
00:28:10 HERE TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH. I AM HERE IN SUPPORT OF 
00:28:15 SOPHIA KING WHO BOLDLY STOOD UP YESTERDAY AND TOLD ALDERMAN 
00:28:23 JOE MOORE-YOU'RE INSULT. THE IDEA THE CITY OF CHICAGO HAS 5 
00:28:36 PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS IN EXISTENCE AND THE COUNTY HAS 
00:28:39 MOVED IN AND PUT THEIR SYSTEM IN WITHOUT GOING TO THE CHAIR OF 
00:28:49 HEALTH. ALDERMAN [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] WHO GETS PERMISSION TO 
00:28:55 TRAIN STAFF IN TELE-TO ALLOW THEM TO MOVE IN AND TAKE UP 
00:29:12 SPACE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 30 PEOPLE THAT WERE MURDERED OVER 
00:29:15 THE WEEKEND OR TRAUMATIZED BY GUN VIOLENCE. WE ARE TALKING 
00:29:20 ABOUT 10 PEOPLE THAT WERE TRAUMATIZED YESTERDAY BY GUN 
00:29:26 VIOLENCE. YOU ALL ARE TAKING THIS AS A JOKE. WE NEED A 51 
00:29:31 ALDERMAN. GEORGE BLAKEMORE NEEDS TO BE THAT. THAT NEEDS TO 
00:29:37 BE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION IN THIS GALLERY AND IN-[INAUDIBLE 
00:29:45 COMMENTS] MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE NOT SOMETHING TO PLAY 
00:29:49 WITH AND THE PEOPLE DYING IN THE STREETS ARE NOT SOMETHING TO 
00:29:52 BE IGNORED. IF THE CITY IS ANYTHING, IF YOU CALL IT A WORLD 
00:29:56 CLASS CITY THEN PUT MENTAL HEALTH FIRST. IF YOU ARE GOING TO 
00:30:01 IT A WORLD CLASS CITY AND IF YOU ARE GOING TO REALLY STAND 
00:30:04 OVER AND STAND WITH EDDIE JOHNSON AND AND NOTICE HE ALWAYS 
00:30:10 DISAPPEARS OFF THE PODIUM. HE CAN DISAPPEAR FOREVER. THIS IS 
00:30:15 THE LAST MEETING. YOU CANNOT STAND IN THE COMMUNITY AND TALK 
00:30:19 ABOUT THE DEATHS OF BROWN AND BLACK AND LATINA CHILDREN AND 
00:30:24 IGNORE THE IDEA MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS ARE BEING SWEPT UNDER 
00:30:28 THE RUG. WE HAVE NOT AND WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO COME HERE AND 
00:30:34 PREACH THESE SERMONS TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN [INAUDIBLE 
00:30:40 COMMENTS] AND SIT HERE AND DO NOTHING BUT COLLECT CHECKS. 
00:30:44 BLACK LIVES MATTER, ALL LIVES MATTER, BUT MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS 
00:30:47 TO BE THE FIRST AND MOST PROMINENT THING. THE LAST FEW 
00:30:56 MINUTES I'M GOING TO SAY THAT THIS CITY NEEDS TO MEET WITH THE 
00:31:01 FAMILY OF STEPHEN ROSENTHOL AND WE NEED TO GET- 
00:31:06 >> THANK YOU. THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JUDY MANSON. 
00:31:19 >> THANK YOU EVERYONE. IT IS A HARD NAME TO PRONOUNCE BUT I'M 
00:31:24 JUDY MANWADEO AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE FRIENDS OF NORTH BRANCH 
00:31:29 PARK AND NATURE PRESERVE AND A LONG TIME NEARLY 40 YEAR 
00:31:33 RESIDENT OF CHICAGO. WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE IS SO MUCH 
00:31:38 CONTROVERSY ABOUT THE TIFF TODAY AND IT IS UP TO YOU OUR 
00:31:40 ELECTED OFFICIALS TO GET IT RIGHT. I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY PEOPLE 
00:31:45 IN THE CITY PLANNING OFFICE THAT THE TIFF IS A WAY TO GET A 
00:31:51 PUBLIC PART IN THIS AREA THAT THERE IS ADDITIONAL UNACCOUNTED 
00:31:55 FOR MONEY PROVIDED IN THE TIFF AND THAT A PUBLIC PARK IS A 
00:32:01 ELIGIBLE COST. IF WHAT THE CITY DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING HAS 
00:32:04 TOLD ME IS TRUE THAT A PUBLIC PARK IS A ELIGIBLE COST IN THE 
00:32:08 CHICAGO RIVER COURTLAND REDEVELOPMENT TIFF I'M FOR THE TIFF. 
00:32:14 GENERAL IRON IS THE ONLY UNACCOUNTED FOR SPACE LEFT IN THIS 
00:32:20 TIFF DEVELOPMENT AREA AND THE CITY MUST ACQUIRE THAT LAND. WE 
00:32:26 ALL KNOW THIS IS SO CONFUSING BUT WE HAVE ELECTED YOU TO DO 
00:32:30 WHAT IS RIGHT FOR OUR CITY. THE WARDS THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL 
00:32:34 EFFECT ARE ALDERMAN BURNETT, SMITH, HOPKINS, WAGUESPACK AND 
00:32:44 [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] IT IS UP TO YOU TO PROPOSE A PARK, GET IT 
00:32:48 VETTED AND PASTED THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT AND FINANCE 
00:32:50 COMMITTEE AND THEN THROUGH CITY COUNCIL. GIVE OUR PARK GROUP 
00:32:54 A BUDGET SO WE CAN MOVE ALONG TO RAISE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS 
00:32:58 FROM FEDERAL AND STATE GRANTS ORGANIZATIONS LIKE TRUST FOR 
00:33:02 PUBLIC LANDS AND OPEN LANDS AS WELL AS THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
00:33:06 WE WILL NEED FROM PHILANTHROPIC DONORS TO MAKE A PUBLIC PARK A 
00:33:11 REALTY. A PARK ALONG THE RIVER IN THIS AREA IS A ONCE IN A 
00:33:16 COUPLE OF LIFETIMES OPPORTUNITY. A PARK ALONG THE RIVER AND 
00:33:22 MAKE THIS NEW NEIGHBORHOOD AS WELL AS THE SURROUNDING 
00:33:26 NEIGHBORS OF BUCKTOWN WICKER PARK, LINCOLN SQUARE AND OLD TOWN 
00:33:33 ARE MORE LIVABLE ONE FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. THANK YOU VERY 
00:33:37 MUCH. 
00:33:38 >> THANK YOU. THE NEXT SPEAKER IS KATE MCCARTER. 
00:33:58 >> MY NAME IS KATE MCCARTER A RESIDENT OF THE SECOND WARD AND 
00:34:04 CLOSE NEIGHBOR TO THE PROPOSED LINCOLN YARD DEVELOPMENT. IF 
00:34:09 PASSED THE TIFF SHOULD MAXIMIZE PUBLIC BENEFIT. BUT THE 
00:34:14 REDEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT EARMARKS FUNDS AS THOUGH UNAWARE THEY 
00:34:19 COULD BE BETTER SPENT. FOR EXAMPLE, THE R DA FEATURES $150 
00:34:27 MILLION TO BUILD OUT THE DOMINIC BRIDGE INSTEAD OF THE 
00:34:30 PREEXISTING GRID. FOR EXAMPLE, IT SIPHONS $15 MILLION TOWARDS 
00:34:36 REMAKING [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] WHEN THESE ROADS WERE ENTIRELY 
00:34:39 REVAMPED A MERE 9 YEARS AGO. FOR EXAMPLE, $45 MILLION IS 
00:34:45 TAGGED FOR SEA WALL IMPROVEMENTS BUT THE CHICAGO MUNICIPAL 
00:34:54 CODE LIARS PROPERTY OWNERS TO MAINTAIN THE RIVER EDGE AND 
00:34:58 SLOPES SEA WALLS AND OTHER ATTACHED STRUCTURES ON THE 
00:35:02 PROPERTY. IN RESPONSE I RETURN TO MAXIMIZING PUBLIC BENEFIT. 
00:35:07 FOR EXAMPLE, THE NORTH BRANCH PARK AND NATURE PRESERVE. IT 
00:35:13 WOULD MITIGATE FLOOD RISK OF LIGHT OF 30 PERCENT INCREASE IN 
00:35:21 LIGHT OF WHAT THE MIDWEST IS GOING TO GET IN THE COMING 
00:35:24 CENTURY. IT WOULD PROVIDE HABITAT FOR BIODIVERSITY 
00:35:29 CONVERSATION AND BIRD MIGRATION AND IT WOULD STEWARD THE 
00:35:33 PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL HEALTH OF ALL CHICAGOANS. 
00:35:40 CHANGES TO THE TIFF ARE THREATENING THE FUTURE OF THE PARK 
00:35:43 WHICH THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE EDITORIAL BOARD WROTE YESTERDAY IS 
00:35:52 NEEDED. THE CHANGES TO THE R DA WHICH ARE ONLY AVAILABLE 
00:35:56 YESTERDAY, THE PARCELS OWNED BY IRON RELOCATED BY 2020 WERE 
00:36:02 EXCLUDED. A COALITION OF 25 ESTABLISHED COMMUNITY DESIGN 
00:36:08 ENVIRONMENTAL RECREATION GROUPS CALLED FOR THIS LAND TO BE 
00:36:12 TURNED INTO A PARK. I RETURN TO MAXIMIZING PUBLIC BENEFIT. 
00:36:17 PUBLICLY OWNED PARK LAND MEETS THIS STANDARD. IT IS 
00:36:22 FUNDAMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE VITAL TO THE SUCCESS OF FUTURE 
00:36:26 DEVELOPMENT TO LINCOLN YARD ITSELF AND TO BE PRIORITIZED IN 
00:36:29 THE CITY AS A WHOLE. MAYOR EMANUEL AND CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS, 
00:36:33 THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
00:36:36 TESTIFY HERE TODAY. I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER MAXIMUM PUBLIC 
00:36:41 BENEFIT FROM THIS TIFF AND R DA. THANK YOU. 
00:36:45 >> THANK YOU. THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ALLEN MILLS. GOOD MORNING. 
00:37:02 GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU. BEFORE I START MY TESTIMONY I LIKE 
00:37:07 TO THANK MAYOR EMANUEL FOR LEADERSHIP OF CHICAGO OVER THE PAST 
00:37:13 8 YEARS. AS I TOLD MY CHILDREN AS THEY LEFT FOR SCHOOL EVERY 
00:37:17 DAY I HOPE YOU AND AMY HAVE FUN. I'M ALLEN [INAUDIBLE 
00:37:21 COMMENTS] LINCOLN PARK COMMUNITY MEMBER OVER 40 YEARS AND 
00:37:24 MEMBER OF ALDERMAN HOPKINS ADVISORY COMMITTEE. I LIKE TO SEE 
00:37:30 THE LINCOLN YARD PROJECT TO BE SUCCESS AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T 
00:37:34 NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMMUNITY. BEFORE YOU VOTE TO APPROVE 
00:37:38 THE TIFF, YOU SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN THE 
00:37:41 REDEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. ONE, ACQUISITION FUNDS FOR THE NORTH 
00:37:46 BRANCH PARK ANDER PRESERVE, TWO. PLANNING FOR A ELEMENTARY

00:38:10 TO BE LOCATED ON SITE. IF THE ABOVE ITEMS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN 
00:38:14 THE REDEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT, THEN AMENDS THE CURRENT TIFF 
00:38:18 ORDINANCE WITH A REQUIREMENT THAT THE CHICAGO CITY COUNCIL HAS 
00:38:23 TO APPROVE TIFF FUNDING PRIOR TO EACH PHASE OF THE PROJECT. 
00:38:28 TO APPROVE TIFF FUNDS TODAY ONLY FOR PHASE ONE WHICH IS TOO 
00:38:33 OFTEN A PARKING STRUCTURE WHICH PAYS FOR THE INTERSECTION 
00:38:37 IMPROVEMENTS AND NEW TRAFFIC SIGNALS. THANK YOU AND I WOULD

01:20:11 >> ITEM 3, 6 ORDINANCES. 3A-F. THIS IS THE PROJECT KNOWN AS 
01:20:19 THE LINCOLN YARDS. RATHER THEN READ WHAT THE DEVELOPMENT IS I 
01:20:28 REFER TO ALDERMAN HOPKINS AND PERHAPS HE COULD DO THAT WHEN IT 
01:20:33 WILL ALLOW YOU FOLKS NOT TO HEAR THE SAME THING TWICE. MR. 
01:20:38 PRESIDENT I ROUGHER REFER TO ALDERMAN HOPKINS. 
01:20:48 >> THANK YOU I ASK FOR THE RIGHT TO CLOSE IN THE EVENT THERE 
01:20:52 ARE QUESTION OR COMMENTARY. VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS 
01:20:56 ITEM. THE CHANGE THAT IS REPRESENTED TODAY IS INCREASE FOR 
01:21:05 WOMEN OWNED BUSINESS MOVES FROM 6 TO 10 PERCENT FOR MINORITY 
01:21:12 OWNED BUSINESS FROM 26 TO 30 PERCENT. IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A 
01:21:17 SIGNIFICANT JUMP BUT IT IS A INFUSION OF CASHES JOBS AND 
01:21:21 BUSINESSES TO MINORITY AND WOMEN OWNED BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN 
01:21:23 THE CITY OF CHICAGO AND THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO STRESS THAT 
01:21:28 THIS IS NOT A GOAL. THIS IS A MANDATE, AND THERE ARE 
01:21:32 MECHANISMS BAKED INTO THIS ARRANGEMENT TO INSURE THE TARGETS 
01:21:38 WILL NOT BE MET. WE WILL NOT ACCEPT EXCUSES OR TRIED AND 
01:21:42 THOUGHT WE COULD DO IT OR COULDN'T DO IT, WE ARE GOING TO DO 
01:21:45 IT. THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. THIS IS A WIN FOR THE CITY 
01:21:51 OF CHICAGO AND THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND THIS WAS A EASY 
01:21:55 CHANGE TO AGREE TO EVEN AT THE LAST HOUR WE DID. IF THERE IS 
01:21:59 ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS I YIELDS THE FLOOR NOW AND MR. 
01:22:02 PRESIDENT ASK- 
01:22:04 >> DAVID MOORE. 
01:22:06 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. AS EVERYONE KNOWS THERE IS A LOT 
01:22:10 OF CONTROVERSY AROUND THIS ISSUE, AND NOBODY MORE THEN ME FROM 
01:22:17 THE START WAS CONCERNED AND SURE THERE WAS OTHERS. ONE THING 
01:22:26 I LIKE THIS ADMINISTRATION UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF SHELLY 
01:22:29 BURKE SHE CONSTANTLY GOT US INVOLVED AND ASKED IN OUR 
01:22:35 COMMUNITIES WHAT IS IN IT FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND BLACK 
01:22:40 PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO I TALK WITH HER AS I PRIDE 
01:22:45 HER AND WORK WITH THE LEADERSHIP NOT ONLY IN THE MAYOR'S 
01:22:48 OFFICE BUT ON THE TEAM IT WAS TO APPOINT THAT I FELT 
01:22:53 COMFORTABLE THAT WE'LL HAVE THINGS TO POINT TO IN OUR 
01:22:56 COMMUNITIES BY MAKING THIS DEVELOPMENT HAPPEN. THE OTHER 
01:22:59 THING WHAT I FOUND INTERESTING IS THAT THE NUMBER OF PHONE 
01:23:03 CALLS THAT I GOT FROM NOT ONLY AFRICAN AMERICAN CONTRACTORS, 
01:23:07 AFRICAN AMERICAN WORKERS, AFRICAN AMERICAN INSURANCE COMPANIES 
01:23:14 AND PEOPLE WHO WILL GET THOSE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AS WELL 
01:23:19 THERE WERE AFRICAN AMERICANS SAYING STAND UP AND SUPPORT THIS. 
01:23:23 I HAD NEVER IN MY LIFE HAD ALL INCLUDING THE ACTIVIST WHO ARE 
01:23:28 KNOCK DOWN BY DOOR THREATENING TO SHUT PROJECTS DOWN ON THE 
01:23:33 SAME PAGE SAYING WE ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THIS. THAT 
01:23:37 MAKES IT DIFFICULT WHEN I SCREAM AND ASK FOR JOBS FOR THESE 
01:23:40 RETURNING CITIZENS AND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BUILDING THEIR 
01:23:45 CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES AND TRYING TO GROW THESE CONSTRUCTION 
01:23:48 COMPANIES FOR ME TO TURN AROUND AND SAY NO TO THEM WILL BE A 
01:23:53 SLAP IN THE FACE AND SO-THAT'S WHAT IT IS IN FOR THE BLACK 
01:23:58 FOLK BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE BLACK CONTRACTORS SO AT THE END OF 
01:24:00 THE DAY I KNOW THAT THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY. I WANT TO 
01:24:04 THANK AGAIN STERLING BAY, SPECIFICALLY SHELLY BURKE AND 
01:24:08 DEFINITELY CONTINUE TO KEEP HER OUT IN FRONT ON THIS 
01:24:12 INITIATIVE AS WE MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY WE HAVE CONTRACTORS 
01:24:15 THAT ARE WORKING BUT WE HAVE THE DEVELOPERS THEMSELVES GROWING 
01:24:22 OUT OF THIS DEAL, SO I FULLY SUPPORT THIS DEAL. THANK YOU. 
01:24:26 >> ALDERMAN MORENO. JOE, NO? OKAY. ANYBODY? ALDERMAN 
01:24:36 SMITH. 
01:24:37 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. THE DEBATE OVER HOW TO USE 
01:24:41 TAXPAYER DOLLARS PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THE PROCESS, TRADITIONS 
01:24:46 AND PRIORITIES IN CITY COUNCIL. MANY BELIEVE IT IS WRONG TO 
01:24:50 TIE UP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF PUBLIC DOLLARS IN A SINGLE 
01:24:53 PROJECT FOR DECADES WHEN WE HAVE A FINANCIAL RECKONING AHEAD. 
01:24:59 THERE IS THE LINGERING ISSUE OF WHAT PUBLIC BENEFIT THIS 
01:25:04 PROJECT PROVIDES. IT IS SUPPOSEDLY-THE TIFF IS SUPPOSED TO 
01:25:09 PROVIDE PUBLIC BENEFIT, BUT IT IS LACKING IN THE LINCOLN YARDS 
01:25:14 DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE YET TO SEE WHO WILL PAY FOR THE SCHOOLS, 
01:25:19 THE LIBRARY AND POLICEMAN THIS MEGA DEVELOPMENT WILL REQUIRE 
01:25:25 AND REMAIN TO BE SEEN WHETHER OR NOT MUCH NEEDED AND PERMANENT 
01:25:30 PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF PARK SPACE CAN BE ACHIEVED AT THIS SITE. 
01:25:35 LIKE SO MANY, I AM HEARTENED BY THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION 
01:25:39 AND BELIEVE WE MUST AS A INSTITUTION HEED THE CALL FOR REAL 
01:25:44 CHANGE IN OUR GOVERNMENT. OUR CITY IS BIGGER THEN ONE 
01:25:49 PROJECT, OUR FUTURE IS MORE COMPLEX THEN ONE VOTE, AND OUR 
01:25:53 MAYOR ELECT IS KEENLY AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES AND ENCOURAGED 
01:26:00 TO WORKING TO INSURE LINCOLN YARD ULTIMATELY WILL BECOME A 
01:26:04 BETTER DEAL FOR TAXPAYERS. I BELIEVE IT CAN AND IT WILL 
01:26:08 BECOME BETTER AND I BELIEVE WE ARE IN THE BRINK OF HISTORIC 
01:26:11 CHANGE. SO, TO THE THOUSANDS OF CITIZENS ACROSS CHICAGO WHO 
01:26:15 OPPOSE THESE PROJECTS IN THE CURRENT FORM, I SAY DO NOT BE 
01:26:19 DISCOURAGED, YOUR VOICES WILL ECHO BEYOND TODAY, STAY ENGAGED, 
01:26:24 STAY FOCUSED AND BE PROUD OF YOUR EFFORTS. THE WORK TO MAKE 
01:26:28 OUR GOVERNMENT BETTER AND THE DECISIONS WISER GOES ON. I WILL 
01:26:33 BE VOTING NO. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:26:34 >> ALDERMAN LOPEZ. 
01:26:36 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW, I HAVE SPOKEN OUT IN 
01:26:44 FAVOR OF LINCOLN YARDS NUMEROUS TIMES BECAUSE IT PUTS PEOPLE 
01:26:50 ON THE SOUTHWEST SIDE TO WORK BUT THAT ISN'T THE DISCUSSION 
01:26:53 WE'LL HAVE TODAY AND NOT THE TOPIC I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. WHAT 
01:26:58 I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF LIES AND 
01:27:02 DECEPTION THAT HAS GONE ON AS IT RELATED OF THEFTS OF BILLIONS 
01:27:08 FROM THE NEIGHBORHOODS. WE HEARD COUNTLESS TIMES OVER AND 
01:27:12 OVER AND OVER YOU ARE STEALING MONEY FROM OUR CHILDREN, FROM 
01:27:15 OUR KIDS. WE CAN'T STEAL WHAT DOESN'T EXIST YET AND THAT IS A 
01:27:19 FACT THAT IS LOST ON MANY AND THAT HAS BEEN A MANTRA REPEATED 
01:27:27 TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THE MONEY, THE PUBLIC BENEFIT ALL THOSE 
01:27:29 ARE GOING TO A AREA THAT IS BEING DEVELOPED, A NEW 
01:27:33 NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WILL BE BROUGHT INTO EXISTENCE. TWO NEW 
01:27:36 NEIGHBORHOODS WITH THE PREVIOUS ITEM AS WELL. WHO WILL PAY 
01:27:39 FOR IT? THE POLICE AND SCHOOLS? THE THOUSANDS OF NEW HOMES 
01:27:44 THAT ARE NOW GOING TO BE PROVIDING PROPERTY TAXES TO RELIEVE 
01:27:47 THE TAX BURDEN ON THE OTHER 77 NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE CITY. 
01:27:52 THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE FIGHTING FOR, THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD 
01:27:56 BE APPLAUDING BECAUSE WHEN ALL THE NEW UNITS PAY TAXES WE CAN 
01:28:01 ADDRESS THE PENSION ISSUE AND HOW TO FULLY FUND GETTING MONEY 
01:28:06 IN THE SCHOOLS WITHOUT BURDENING EVERYONE ELSE IN THE CITY. 
01:28:12 PROVIDE NEW DOLLARS FOR EVERYTHING EVERYONE WANTS RESOURCES 
01:28:18 FOR. WE ARE LEVELING THE ECONOMIC PLAYING FIELD SO 
01:28:22 COMMUNITIES THAT PAY CAN SHOULDER THE BURDEN WITH THE NEW 
01:28:25 COMMUNITY PARTNERS. 10S OF THOUSANDS OF NEW HOMES PROVIDING 
01:28:29 TAXES, 10S OF THOUSANDS OF NEW EMPLOYEES SPENDING IN 
01:28:34 COMMUNITIES. THAT'S THE TRUTH BEHIND THIS MATTER. THE FACT 
01:28:38 OF THE MATTER THAT WE CONTINUE TO TRY AND FALL FOR THESE LIES 
01:28:42 IS DESPICABLE THAT CERTAIN GROUPS AND SPECIAL INTEREST LIE TO 
01:28:47 THE PEOPLE TO DIVIDE THEM AND SAY THIS IS A RACIAL ISSUE YOU 
01:28:50 ARE STEALING FROM NEIGHBORHOODS AND STEALING FROM INGLEWOOD IS 
01:28:56 FALSE. IT IS DESPICABLE. THAT IS NOT HOW THIS BODY SHOULD 
01:29:02 OPERATE, THAT'S NOT HOW OUR PARTNER SHOULD OPERATE AND GIVE A 
01:29:07 WORD OF CAUTION TO EVERYONE COMING HERE IN A MONTH, THAT KIND 
01:29:12 OF DIVISIVE RHETORIC TO TRY TO MAKE A POINT SHOULD NOT BE 
01:29:16 ACCEPTABLE TO ANYBODY. IT IS ABSOLUTELY [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] 
01:29:21 TO ME AND CALLED OUT EVERY TIME FOR WHAT IT IS. GARBAGE. 
01:29:25 THIS IS A GOOD DEAL FOR PEOPLE ALL THROUGHOUT THE CITY OF 
01:29:28 CHICAGO BASED ON FACT. THAT YOU ARE NOT STEALING, YOU ARE 
01:29:33 GENERATING AND IN ORDER TO GENERATE YOU MUST BUILD AND 
01:29:36 BUILDING IS WHAT THIS ALLOWS US TO DO. THANK YOU, MR. 
01:29:39 PRESIDENT. 
01:29:40 >> ALDERMAN HOPKINS TO CLOSE. ALDERMAN, HOLD ON. ALDERMAN 
01:29:45 WAGUESPACK. 
01:29:50 >> THANK YOU, I'LL BE SHORT BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WANT TO GET 
01:29:53 THIS PASSED AND GET OUT OF HERE. WE TALKED ABOUT TRANSPARENCY 
01:30:02 AND LACK OF IT IN THE DEAL. THE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY, 
01:30:04 RECEIVING A 600 PAGE R DA AMENDED JUST A COUPLE DAYS AGO AND 
01:30:09 REELING THROUGH THE R DA AND SEEING MORE ISSUES THAT HAVE 
01:30:13 COPPED UP THAT DON'T BENEFIT TAXPAYERS BUT DO BENEFIT THE 
01:30:17 DEVELOPER. THAT'S FINE IF WE ARE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT AT 
01:30:23 SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE THE TIFF WHICH LASTS 23 YEARS DOES 
01:30:28 PUT THAT MONEY BACK IN THE SYSTEM AND IT DOES. WE HAVE TO 
01:30:31 WAIT 23 YEARS, GUYS. 23 YEARS BEFORE WE'LL SEE PROPERTY TAXES 
01:30:37 FLOWING IN FROM THE FLEET FACILITY SOLD LAST YEAR. THE 
01:30:42 PROPERTY STILL ASSESSED AT ZERO. THAT IS JUST ONE POINT OUT 
01:30:48 OF MANY COMMUNITY IN THE AREA AS WE WORK ON THE FRAMEWORK 
01:30:56 DISSOLVING THE PMD SAID HERE ARE THINGS WE WANT IN THE AREA. 
01:31:00 THEY WERE NOT SAYING SUCK ALL THE MONEY INTO LINCOLN PARK AND 
01:31:04 BUCK TOWN, THEY WERE SAYING SPREAD THE WEALTH AND LET'S NOT 
01:31:08 SOCK ALL THE MONEY INTO TIFF FOR THE NEXT 23 YEARS, SPREAD IT 
01:31:12 AROUND THE CITY. IF YOU WERE AT THE MEETINGS YOU WOULD HAVE 
01:31:15 HEARD THE SAME THING. THE PEOPLE IN BOTH OF THOSE COMMUNITIES 
01:31:20 WERE THINKING OF THE CITY AS A WHOLE AND HAVE BEEN THROUGHOUT 
01:31:23 THE PROCESS SO IT HASN'T BEEN LIES AND DECEPTION FROM 
01:31:32 COMMUNITY IS LIES AND DECEPTION BUILT INTO THE PROJECT FROM 
01:31:36 DAY ONE. THERE WERE A LOT OF DOCUMENTS OUT THERE WE WERE 
01:31:38 NEVER ABLE TO GET A HOLD OF AND HOPE THE MANDATE WITH THE NEW 
01:31:42 MAYOR IT CHANGES THE WAY THE COUNCIL APPROACHES GOVERNING. 
01:31:46 THAT IS THE INHERENT PROBLEM WE HAVE HERE. WE DON'T LISTEN TO 
01:31:51 THE COMMUNITY. GEORGE BLAKEMOORE STOOD UP AND SAID A FEW 
01:31:56 GOODS WORDS ABOUT WHAT OUR JOB IS IN THE FUTURE. WE NEED TO 
01:31:59 TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY AND I TAKE OFFENSE WHEN A ALDERMAN SAYS WE 
01:32:02 DONT KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN OWN COMMUNITY. A TIFF 
01:32:09 IS FOR 23 YEARS. WE'LL SEE WHERE THE MONEY WILL FLOW IN BUT 
01:32:16 HALF WILL BE LONG GONE FROM THE COUNCIL BEFORE WE SEE THE 
01:32:19 FUNDS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A 
01:32:20 OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK THOUGH AS THE NEW COUNCIL COMES IN, 
01:32:23 LOOK AT THESE, MAKE SURE WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE DEALS CUT 
01:32:27 AND MAKE THEM BETTER FOR TAXPAYERS. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:32:31 >> ALDERMAN HOPKINS TO CLOSE. 
01:32:34 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. WE ARE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON A ROLL 
01:32:39 CALL VOTE THAT FOR ME IS THE CULMINATION OF A JOURNEY THAT 
01:32:43 BEGAN BEFORE I BECAME ELECTED ALDERMAN IN CHICAGO. AS A 
01:32:48 CANDIDATE FOR THIS OFFICE KNOWING THAT THE WORD I WAS RUNNING 
01:32:51 IN CONTAINED THE INDUSTRIAL AREA THAT IS NOW SLATED TO BECOME 
01:32:56 LINCOLN YARDS AND KNOWING MOST OF THE INDUSTRIAL JOBS LEFT THE 
01:33:01 AREA OR IN THE PROCESS OF LEAVING THE AREA. WE WERE GOING TO 
01:33:04 BE FACED WITH THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE NOW. ACRES OF UNUSED IN 
01:33:11 MANY CASES CONTAMINATED LAND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH AND 
01:33:14 I TOOK A POSITION AS A CANDIDATE THE PREOPERATIVE USE OF THE 
01:33:18 LAND IS MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT AS OUR CITY GROWS AND AS OUR 
01:33:22 ECONOMY GROWS AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS A COMMUNITY, WE NEED 
01:33:26 TO THINK BIGGER. WE NEED TO THINK BOLDER AND COULDN'T BE 
01:33:31 CONSTRAINED BY THE PLANNED MANUFACTURING DISTRICT ZONING 
01:33:35 REQUIREMENT THAT WORKED VERY WELL FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. IT 
01:33:38 DID ITS JOB AND GOT US TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY BUT IT WAS NO 
01:33:41 LONGER APPROPRIATE FOR THE FUTURE AND THAT WASN'T A DECISION I 
01:33:44 MADE. THAT WASN'T A DECISION ANYONE IN THE BODY MADE, THAT 
01:33:47 WAS A DECISION MADE BY THE ECONOMICS OF THE SITUATION. MADE 
01:33:51 BY THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON DECIDED 
01:33:55 THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE AT THAT LOCATION. 
01:33:58 MANY MOVED TO YOUR WARD ALDERMAN GARZA, SOME LEFT THE COMPANY 
01:34:03 AND SOME CEASED OPERATION BUT THEY ALL DECIDED OF THEIR OWN 
01:34:06 VOLITION THEY DID NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE ON THE LAND 
01:34:11 SLATED TO BECOME LINCOLN YARDS AND THAT RAISES THE QUESTION, 
01:34:15 WHAT IS IT GOING TO BE? WE'LL ANSWER THE QUESTION TODAY AND 
01:34:18 THE REASON WE ARE GOING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IN THE 
01:34:20 REMEMBER AFFIRMATIVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME AS THE ALDERMAN 
01:34:28 IN THE WARD. NOT ONCE DID I ASK YOU PLEASE VOTE FOR THIS 
01:34:34 BECAUSE IT IS IN THE SECOND WARD AND I'M THE SECOND WARD 
01:34:41 ALDERMAN. THAT WASN'T PERSUASIVE AND DIDN'T TRY TO GO THERE. 
01:34:45 WHAT IS PERSUASIVE IS THE MERITS OF IT FOR THE CITY, THE 
01:34:52 COMMUNITY BENEFITS AND WHAT WILL BRING TO US AS A CITY. THAT 
01:34:55 IS WHY YOU ARE SUPPORTING IT AND STANDING WITH ME TODAY. THE 
01:35:00 IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO BECAUSE OF THE JOBS AND ECONOMIC 
01:35:02 DEVELOPMENT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT, BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC 
01:35:05 INFRASTRUCTURE BENEFITS THAT IT WILL PROVIDE FOR THE 
01:35:08 NEIGHBORHOOD IT NEEDS SO DESPERATELY AND BECAUSE OF THE 
01:35:12 AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT BRINGS TO THE CITY AND I WANT TO TOUCH 
01:35:17 ON FORDABLE HOUSING. IN 2007 THIS BODY PASSED THE A R O 
01:35:22 ORDINANCE. SOME ARE HERE, SOME OF YOU WERE NOT BUT WE ALL 
01:35:27 KNOW THE RAMIFICATIONS OF IT AND THE GOAL OF AFFORDABLE 
01:35:30 HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. SINCE THAT TIME TO TODAY, THE NUMBER OF 
01:35:34 AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED UNDER THE A 
01:35:38 R O ARE 837 AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS SINCE 2007. THIS VOTE 
01:35:45 TODAY IN ONE FELL SWOOP IS MORE THEN DOUBLING THAT. WE ARE 
01:35:49 BUILDING 900 AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS BECAUSE OF LINCOLN 
01:35:53 YARDS. 600 ON SITE AND 300 IN THE NEARBY AREA. WE ARE MORE 
01:35:58 THEN DOUBLING THE WORK THAT IT TOOK US 12 YEARS TO DO UP UNTIL 
01:36:02 THIS POINT BECAUSE OF ONE DEVELOPMENT. THAT IS WHY YOU'RE 
01:36:05 VOTING YES, MANY OF YOU. IT ST. THE RIGHT THING TO DO. YOU 
01:36:08 ARE ALSO VOTING YES BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE 
01:36:11 BENEFITS WE ARE GOING TO SEE, THE NEW 11 ACRE PARK, THE 3 
01:36:15 BRIDGES OVER THE CHICAGO RIVER, THE METRO STATION, THE 
01:36:20 IMPROVEMENTS ON THE ROAD, THE UNTANGLING OF [INAUDIBLE 
01:36:24 COMMENTS] ASHLAND INTERSECTION. ALL THOSE THINGS WE NEED 
01:36:28 TODAY AND NECESSARY NOW AND HAVE NO OTHER WAY TO PAY FOR THEM 
01:36:30 WITHOUT LINCOLN YARDS. PEOPLE TALK AS A SUBSIDY TO THE 
01:36:36 DEVELOPER, THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. LINCOLN YARDS DEVELOPERS ARE 
01:36:39 BRINGING ALL MOST $300 MILLION OF THEIR OWN PRIVATE CAPITAL TO 
01:36:44 PAY FOR THOSE IMPROVEMENTS. OUR PIECE ON THE TIFF IS $490 
01:36:49 MILLION OF TAX MONEY THAT IS GOING TO PAY FOR THINGS TAX MONEY 
01:36:55 USUALLY PAYS FOR. IT PAYS FOR THE ALL THE BRIDGES AND ALL THE 
01:36:59 ROADS. THAT IS WHAT TAX MONEY IS FOR. MAKING THE DEVELOPMENT 
01:37:03 POSSIBLE AND THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL SUBSIDIZE THE CITY OF 
01:37:06 CHICAGO. ON THE JOBS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PIECE WE TALKED 
01:37:09 EARLIER ABOUT THE MINORITY AND WOMEN BUSINESS PARTICIPATION 
01:37:14 LEVEL AT 30 PERCENT AND 10 PERCENT, THAT IS THERE RIGHT THING 
01:37:17 TO DO FOR THE CITY AND ONE REASON MAYOR LIGHTFOOT-I TIP HER TO 
01:37:27 COME AT THE 11 HOUR AND V A CONVERSATION WITH MAYOR EMANUEL 
01:37:32 AND THE DEVELOPER THAT IS UNPRECEDENTED IN THE CITY. WE HAVE 
01:37:35 NEVER SEEN THOSE LEVELS AGREED TO NOT AS A TARGET BUT AS A 
01:37:39 MANDATE. WE SET A PRECEDENT TODAY. 24 THOUSAND PERMANENT 
01:37:43 CORPORATE JOBS THAT WILL COME TO THE CITY BECAUSE OF THIS AND 
01:37:46 10 THOUSAND UNION CONSTRUCTION JOBS THAT WILL LAST AT LEAST 10 
01:37:53 YEARS PUT PEOPLE 250 WORK AS WE BUILD THE CONTAMINATING TOXIC 
01:37:57 WASTE LANDS TO THE FUTURE. IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND 
01:38:02 THE BENEFITS ACCRUE FOR GENERATIONS TO COME, WE'LL ENJOY THE 
01:38:07 BENEFITS 23 YEARS FROM NOW. WE WILL SEE TIFF EXPIRING IN THE 
01:38:11 NEXT COUPLE YEARS PEOPLE 20 YEARS AGO HAD THE VISION TO FORM 
01:38:14 AND WE ARE GOING TO THANK THOSE PEOPLE WHO FORM THOSE TIFFS 20 
01:38:18 PLUS YEARS AGO. PEOPLE WILL THANK US 20 YEARS INTO THE FUTURE 
01:38:23 FOR THE DECISION WE ARE MAKING TODAY. IT BENEFITS OUR CITY 
01:38:26 AND IT BRINGS ABOUT THE REALTY WE ALL TALKED ABOUT MORE JOBS, 
01:38:31 MORE ECONOMIC BENEFIT, MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, IT IS THE 
01:38:34 RIGHT THING TO DO AND THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. 
01:38:40 >> ALDERMAN O'CONNOR TO CLOSE. 
01:38:42 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE TWO POINTS. 
01:38:47 WHAT WE HAVE DONE AT O' HARE IS GOING TO ALLOW MEN AND WOMEN 
01:38:51 WHO WORK IN THE TRADE IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY TO WORK THE 
01:38:55 MAJORITY OF THEIR WORKING LIFE AT THAT LOCATION REMODELING 
01:39:00 THAT AIRPORT. WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW IS PASSING A PROJECT THAT 
01:39:06 WILL ALLOW MEN AND WOMEN IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY TO WORK 
01:39:10 AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF THEIR WORKING LIFE AT A LOCATION PEP 
01:39:15 HELPING TO BRING BENEFITS TO THE CITY AND THAT IS TEMPORARY 
01:39:20 JOBS. THE PERMANENT JOBS COME AS THE DEVELOPMENT COMES ON AND 
01:39:26 ON THE PERMANENT JOBS NUMBER FOR THIS SITE IN EXCESS IS OF 25 
01:39:30 THOUSAND. THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD DEAL FOR THE CITY NOW MATTER 
01:39:37 HOW YOU SLICE IT BECAUSE IT ISN'T ALL THOSE PEOPLE IN THAT 
01:39:40 LIVE IN THE AREA THAT ARE WORKING THERE, NOT DURING 
01:39:44 CONSTRUCTION AND DURING THE TIME THE PROJECT IS FINISHED SO I 
01:39:47 ARE WANT TO CONGRATULATE ALDERMAN HOPKINS FOR THE WORK 
01:39:52 BRINGING IT TO THIS POINT AND CONGRATULATE THE MAYOR'S OFFICE 
01:39:55 FOR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE MAYOR ELECT TO INSURE THAT WE 
01:40:00 PAID THE RESPECT APPROPRIATE TO SPECT APPROPRIATE TO A 
01:40:05 INCOMING MAYOR AND I THINK THAT IN THE END THE CITIZENS OF 
01:40:10 CHICAGO WILL BENEFIT BY THIS AND I MOVE THIS MATTER BY ROLL

01:42:20 >> MOTION TO RECONSIDER THE VOTE. 
01:42:23 >> ALL THOSE IN FAVOR SAY AYE. THOSE OPPOSED, NO. MOTION 
01:42:29 FAILED. ALDERMAN O'CONNOR, BEFORE YOU SPEAK I LIKE TO PUT ALL 
01:42:36 THE LAST 3 VOTES IN CONTEXT OF WHERE WE ARE AS A CITY. THE 
01:42:44 MOST IMPORTANT THING TO ME IS WHETHER YOU TAKE THE ONE IN THE 
01:42:48 10TH WARD, THE ONE IN THE 25 AND 2 AND BEYOND. 11 YEARS AGO, 
01:42:55 WE OR 8 YEARS AGO IN 2011 WE SET OUT TO MAKE CHICAGO A CITY TO 
01:43:01 CREATE JOBS, WHETHER MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIAL JOBS, 
01:43:04 CONSTRUCTION JOBS, OFFICE JOBS, ACROSS THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:43:08 EVERY ONE OF THESE INVESTMENTS WILL LAST THE SAME AMOUNT OF 
01:43:12 TIME. EVERYONE WILL PAY DIVIDENDS BEYOND THE PHYSICAL SPACE 
01:43:19 WHETHER THAT IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING, OPEN SPACE. WHETHER THAT 
01:43:23 IS IMPROVEMENTS ALONG THE RIVER THAT GO BEYOND THIS AREA. 
01:43:27 WHETHER THAT IS FOR NEIGHBORHOOD OPPORTUNITY FUNDS RESOURCES 
01:43:30 FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ON THE SOUTHWEST SIDE. WHETHER IN FACT 
01:43:33 IN THIS AREA IT WILL ALSO BE UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT IN THE 
01:43:38 INDUSTRIAL ZONES THAT COMPLIMENT THE INVESTMENT WE MADE 
01:43:47 [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] EVERY STEPS WE HAVE TAKEN OVER 8 YEARS 
01:43:51 ALLOWED CHICAGO TO BE DIRECT FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NUMBER ONE 
01:43:59 CITY FOR CORPORATE RELOCATION. TODAY WE HAVE THE LOWEST 
01:44:03 UNEMPLOYMENT ON RECORD AND HIGHEST EMPLOYMENT. THESE ARE 
01:44:06 INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE THAT ARE NOT BOUND BY THE BOUNDARY 
01:44:09 OF THE SPACE. THEY ACTUALLY PAY DIVIDENDS THROUGHOUT THE CITY 
01:44:14 OF CHICAGO AND THAT REASON IS BECAUSE THE CHANGES WE 
01:44:17 COLLECTIVELY MADE OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS TO MAKE SURE WE 
01:44:21 MADE AN INVESTMENT THAT BENEFITS NOT RESTRICTED, BUT ACTUALLY 
01:44:26 GONE ACROSS THE CITY OF CHICAGO IN DIFFERENT ENDEAVORS. THAT 
01:44:31 IS HOW YOU ADVANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SMALL NEIGHBORHOOD 
01:44:36 BUSINESS AND ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY FOR FRIENDS OF 
01:44:41 THE RIVER FOR THE FIRST GROUP TO ENDORSE BOTH OF THE PROJECTS. 
01:44:45 WE HAD A LONG PROCESS OF THREE YEARS, MULTIPLE MEETINGS 
01:44:52 ITERATIONS AND CHANGES, THAT IS A GOOD THING THAT HAPPENED AND 
01:44:57 IT IS NOT DONE. THERE IS INCREDIBLE IMPROVEMENTS AND CHANGES 
01:45:00 ALONG THE WAY. YOUR VOICES, OTHERS WILL BE HEARD AND THERE 
01:45:04 WILL BE GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY TO MEET THE GOALS WE SET OUT. 
01:45:08 COLLECTIVELY. I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN A LONG DEBATE, BUT I LIKE 
01:45:12 TO PUT THIS IN THE CONTEXT THAT EVERY ONE OF THE SITES LIKE 
01:45:17 THE POST OFFICE HAVE BEEN EMPTY FOR YEARS, DECADES, SOMETIMES 
01:45:23 TO 78. ALL MOST A CENTURY. IF WE WANT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS 
01:45:29 OF PUTTING MORE KIDS LIKE WE SAW EARLIER INTO AFTER SCHOOL AND 
01:45:32 SUMMER JOBS AND MENTORING PROGRAMS WE WANT TO INVEST IN MORE 
01:45:36 ACTIVITIES AND MORE GOALS FOR OUR CITY WHETHER THAT IS 
01:45:40 AFFORDABLE HOUSING, MORE INDUSTRIAL JOBS SO PEOPLE OF ALL 
01:45:46 WALKS OF LIFE HAVE A OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A GOOD LIFE. YOU 
01:45:49 CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT GROWING AND GROWING IS THE FUNDAMENTAL 
01:45:52 NORTH STAR OF OUR CITY BEYOND MY TENURE FOR ALL OF US. WE HAD 
01:45:57 A GOOD SOLID DEBATE THAT IS COMPLIMENT TO THE DEMOCRATIC 
01:46:01 PROCESS. THAT PROCESS ISN'T OVER, THERE WILL BE PLACES ALONG 
01:46:04 THE WAY AS THE ALDERMAN NOTED TO ACTUALLY MAKE THAT 
01:46:06 CONTRIBUTION. IF YOU STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THIS, WHEN YOU PUT 
01:46:12 ALL THREE OF THESE PROJECTS TOGETHER THEY ARE THE EQUIVALENT 
01:46:15 OF ANOTHER INVESTMENT, ANOTHER MIDWAY INVESTMENT AND RED 
01:46:22 PURPLE MODERNIZATION. THAT'S A INCREDIBLE STATEMENT THAT IN 
01:46:25 THE WORST OF TIMES WE ALSO HAVE INVESTMENTS THAT CREATE THE 
01:46:30 BEST OF TIMES FOR THE CITY OF CHICAGO. I KNOW THERE IS A LOT 
01:46:34 OF HARD FEELINGS AND STRONG FEELINGS AND THAT'S OKAY, BUT AT 
01:46:37 THE ENDS OF THE DAY WE HAD THAT DEBATER, IT IS TIME TO MOVE 
01:46:40 FORWARD AND SHAPE A SINGLE FUTURE FOR THE CHILDREN THAT WERE 
01:46:43 JUST HERE AND MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A CITY THAT CONTINUE TO BE 
01:46:47 OPEN FOR BUSINESS AND WELCOMES INVESTMENTS AND OPPORTUNITIES 
01:46:50 FOR THEIR FUTURE. CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYBODY THAT 
01:46:53 PARTICIPATED REGARDLESS OF THE VOTE THEY TOOK TO MAKING THIS 
01:46:56 DAY HAPPEN. ALDERMAN O'CONNOR. 
01:46:58 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST ADDRESS ONE

02:40:22 >> ALDERMAN SANTIAGO. 
02:40:24 >> THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT. I ALSO RISE TO HONOR MARTHA 
02:40:28 RAMOS WITH THIS RESOLUTION. I KNEW MARTHA SINCE I FIRST CAME 
02:40:33 TO CHICAGO AND PART OF THE PARADE COMMITTEE AND HER FATHER WAS 
02:40:43 THE PRESIDENT. SHE WAS SO YOUNG AND DEMONSTRATED SUCH 
02:40:47 LEADERSHIP. SHE WAS SOMEONE WHO WORKED REALLY HARD FOR THE 
02:40:50 COMMUNITY WHO PUT HER HEART IN EVERYTHING SHE DID. I REMEMBER 
02:40:56 DURING THOSE EARLY YEARS IN EARLY 80'S WHEN SHE WAS SO 
02:41:02 COMMITTED TO THE COMMUNITY AND SHE DID AN AMAZING JOB WHEN SHE 
02:41:05 WAS PART OF THE PARADE COMMITTEE AND WAS ALSO PART OF IT. 
02:41:09 MARTHA ALSO WORKED FOR ME FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WHEN ONE 
02:41:13 OF MY STAFFERS WERE ON MEDICAL LEAVE AND WHAT SHE BROUGHT TO 
02:41:18 MY OFFICE WAS KNOWLEDGE, EXPERIENCE, COMMITMENT AND 
02:41:23 WILLINGNESS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MY OFFICE, ESPECIALLY 
02:41:25 BECAUSE OF THAT EXPERIENCE SHE HAD. I DO REMEMBER WHEN SHE 
02:41:30 MADE IT TO THE NEWS HEADLINES THAT DAY WHEN SHE WAS CHASING A 
02:41:35 CRIMINAL DOWN THE STREET THAT WAS STABBING PEOPLE RANDOMLY AND 
02:41:38 LATER ON THANKS TO HER COURAGE THAT GUY WAS ABLE TO BE 
02:41:47 APPREHENDED. WHEN WE HEARD ABOUT MARTHA'S DEPARTURE, WE WERE 
02:41:53 SHOCKED AND COULDN'T BELIEVE IT BECAUSE SHE WAS FULL OF LIFE. 
02:41:56 HER DEDICATION TO HER DAD AND HER GRANDCHILDREN WAS AMAZING. 
02:42:01 SOMETHING THAT WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE IN OUR HEARTS. HER 
02:42:05 PRIORITY WAS FAMILY, ESPECIALLY TO CARE FOR HER ILL FATHER AND 
02:42:10 WHEN SHE BROUGHT HER GRANDCHILDREN TO MY OFFICE, YOU COULD SEE 
02:42:16 THOSE CHILDREN WERE THE LOVE OF HER LIFE. SO, I WILL FOREVER 
02:42:22 REMEMBER HER THIS CONTAGIOUS SMILE SHE HAD. SHE WAS SO 
02:42:28 HELPFUL AND NEVER SAID NO TO ANYTHING AND SHE WOULD BE THERE 
02:42:32 TO HELP US, TO HELP WITH THE SENIOR EVENTS AND OTHER COMMUNITY 
02:42:36 EVENTS BECAUSE SHE WAS THE PERSON I ALWAYS COULD COUNT ON. 
02:42:44 [SPEAKING SPANISH] 
02:42:57 AND TO THE REST OF HER FAMILY HERE, I'M SURE THAT MARTHA IS 
02:43:04 DEARLY MISSED. I'M SURE SHE IS. BOUGHT SHE IS IN A BETTER 
02:43:08 PLACE, AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHEN SOMEONE 
02:43:12 LEAVES US IS THAT THOSE GOOD THINGS THAT WE DO IN LIFE THAT 
02:43:16 ARE FOREVER REMEMBERED ARE WHAT REALLY MATTER AND I KNOW THAT 
02:43:23 DANIELLE AND YOU ARE GOING THROUGH A VERY DIFFICULT TIME, BUT 
02:43:27 THAT WOULD HELP YOU HEAL. MAKE HER REST IN PEACE AND SHE WILL 
02:43:32 FOREVER BE REMEMBERED. THANK YOU.

02:43:55 NEIGHBORING ALDERMAN AND LOOKED FOR GUIDANCE ON THINGS WE WERE 
02:43:58 WORKING ON IN LOGAN SQUARE AND EVERY TIME I SAW MARTHA SHE 
02:44:05 ALWAYS HAD A SMILE ON HER FACE AND VERY KIND TO MY STAFF AND 
02:44:09 THE WORK WE WERE DOING AND SURE THAT WAS THE SAME FOR THE 
02:44:14 SURROUNDING ALDERMAN AND OFFICES. SHE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT AND 
02:44:18 HARD WORK MAKING THE 35 WARD A GREAT PLACE TO LIVE AND TO 
02:44:21 WELCOME FAMILIES TO THAT AREA. AS YOU ARE GOING THROUGH THIS 
02:44:25 HARD TIME, THIS HARD SITUATION, WE PRAY FOR YOU AND HOPE THAT 
02:44:29 AS A FAMILY YOU CAN STAY TOGETHER, STAY STRONG, AND KNOW THAT 
02:44:33 PEOPLE ARE THERE FOR YOU IF YOU NEED IT AND WISH YOU WELL AS 
02:44:38 YOU MOVE FORWARD, BUT WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN ALDERMAN ROSA

03:00:26 [GAVEL] 
03:00:29 (APPLAUSE) 
03:00:32 ALDERMAN O'CONNOR. OR AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS PAT. 
03:00:42 >> MR. PRESIDENT, MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL, I RISE IN SUPPORT OF 
03:00:47 THIS AND I START MY REMARKS BY APOLOGIZING, BECAUSE WE HAD A 
03:00:56 FINE READING WITH TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS NO 
03:01:01 RESOLUTION CAN SUM UP THE THINGS RAHM EMANUEL HAS DONE FOR THE 
03:01:05 CITY NOT JUST IN HIS TERM-TWO TERMS AS MAYORS BUT TIME IN 
03:01:10 PUBLIC SERVICE. I HAVE HAD A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE OVER ALL THE 
03:01:18 ALDERMAN IN THE COUNCIL THE LAST 8 YEARS IN THAT I HAD A 
03:01:23 RELATIONSHIP WITH RAHM EMANUEL LONG BEFORE I ACTUALLY MET HIM. 
03:01:30 MY WIFE AND I HAD HAVE 5 CHILDREN, AND I USED TO SEE HIS 
03:01:36 PICTURE IN HIS FATHER'S OFFICE AS HIS PRACTICE AS A 
03:01:43 PEDIATRICIAN AND SAW HIM IN VARIOUS ITERATIONS AS HE WAS 
03:01:47 GETTING OLDER AND I WAS IN THERE WITH MY SUCCEEDING CHILDREN, 
03:01:51 AND IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT IS A TRAIT THAT THE MAYOR 
03:01:55 ACTUALLY I THINK INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER. HE TALKS ABOUT 
03:02:01 HIS CHILDREN ALL THE TIME AND HE TELLS YOU HOW PROUD HE IS OF 
03:02:05 THEM. HIS FATHER WAS ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT RAHM. AND HE DID 
03:02:13 MENTION THE OTHERS ONCE IN A WHILE. 
03:02:16 [LAUGHTER] 
03:02:17 BUT I ALSO GOT TO KNOW MAYOR EMANUEL I THINK BEFORE MOST OF 
03:02:26 YOU KNEW HIM IN THE ROLE OF PUBLIC SERVANT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY 
03:02:32 HE WAS A POLITICAL PERSON AND POLITICAL OPERATIVE AND 
03:02:38 TREMENDOUS FUND RAISER BEFORE HE WENT INTO PUBLIC SERVICE AND 
03:02:42 I MAY HAVE SAID THIS BEFORE, BUT I MET HIM WHEN HE WAS RUNNING 
03:02:48 FOR CONGRESS ON A SATURDAY MORNING IN A NEIGHBORHOOD 
03:02:53 RESTAURANT. I MET HIM AT THE REQUEST OF THEN MAYOR DALEY AND 
03:02:59 FOR THOSE WHO HAD THE PRIVILEGE SERVING WITH MAYOR DALEY YOU 
03:03:05 KNOW OFTEN TIMES YOU CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH HIM AND 
03:03:09 LEAVE THE ROOM AND NOT SURE WHAT HE SAID OR ASKED OF YOU, BUT 
03:03:12 YOU WOULD BASICALLY BE LEFT TO DO WHAT HE WANTED YOU TO DO 
03:03:18 BECAUSE HE WAS CLEAR WHAT HE WANTED THE OUTCOME TO BE SO WHEN 
03:03:22 I WENT IN THAT DAY TO SEE RICH DALEY, HE SAID TO ME, I LIKE 
03:03:26 YOU TO CONSIDER SUPPORTING RAHM EMANUEL FOR CONGRESS IN YOUR 
03:03:31 DISTRICT. IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST DIRECT CONVERSATIONS I EVER 
03:03:36 HAD WITH MAYOR DALEY. IN THE PAST HE MIGHT HAVE SAID, WOULD 
03:03:40 YOU CONSIDER SUPPORTING RAHM EMANUEL FOR CONGRESS, BUT THAT 
03:03:45 DAY HE SAID,B I WOULD LIKE YOU TO SUPPORT RAHM EMANUEL FOR 
03:03:50 CONGRESS IN YOUR DISTRICT. I SAID TO HIM, I SAID, IS HE GOOD 
03:03:54 AND WILL HE BE GOOD IN CONGRESS? AND HE SAID, HE'S A GREAT 
03:04:00 FELLOW AND HE WILL BE GOOD FOR THE CITY OF CHICAGO, HE WILL BE 
03:04:05 GOOD FOR YOU IN YOUR DISTRICT AND NEIGHBORHOOD AND GOOD FOR ME 
03:04:09 AS THE MAYOR OF THE CITY FOR THE THINGS WE NEED. DURING THE 
03:04:12 TIME THAT HE SERVED IN CONGRESS MAYOR DAILY'S WORDS WERE 
03:04:18 PROPHETIC AND MAYOR EMANUEL LIVED UP TO EVERYTHING THAT I HAD 
03:04:23 EXPECTED AND TOLD HE WOULD. WE HAD A LITTLE FALLING OUT WHILE 
03:04:28 HE WAS IN CONGRESS BECAUSE ONE DAY HE CALLED AND SAID I'M 
03:04:31 LEAVING CONGRESS AND GOING TO BE THE PRESIDENT CHIEF OF STAFF. 
03:04:36 I SAID, THAT'S A MISTAKE IN MY OPINION. THAT'S A ONE YOUR, 
03:04:42 TWO YEAR JOB AT BEST AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE SPEAKER OF THE 
03:04:47 HOUSE AND DO TREMENDOUS THINGS FOR THE CITY OF CHICAGO FROM 
03:04:52 THAT VANTAGE POINT IN CONGRESS AND WE CANT AFFORD TO LEAVE 
03:04:55 SOMEBODY WITH YOUR TALENTS OUT OF THAT BODY AND BEING A BODY 
03:05:00 THAT REQUIRES SENIORITY, IF YOU LEAVE YOU'RE GOING TO HURT 
03:05:05 THAT TRACK YOU ARE ON AND I THINK IT HURTS THE CITY. AND HE 
03:05:09 SAID SOMETHING THAT I THINK WAS IMPRESSED ME THAT DAY, HE 
03:05:14 SAID, WHAT YOU ARE SAYING WOULD BE NICE, YOU CANNOT TURN THE 
03:05:19 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DOWN WHEN HE ASKS YOU TO SERVE. 
03:05:24 NOT ONLY WAS HE A GOOD CONGRESSMAN BUT A PATRIOT. WHEN WE 
03:05:30 TALKED WHEN HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO RUN FOR MAYOR, HE CALLED 
03:05:36 ME AND SAID WE WOULD YOU BE WITH ME, AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANY 
03:05:44 HESITATION. I KNEW HE WOULD BE GOOD. I HAVE ENJOYED IT. I 
03:05:51 HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE, AND YOU DIDN'T JUST 
03:06:01 DO THAT FOR ME, I DON'T KNOW ANY ALDERMAN IN THE CHAMBER WHO 
03:06:07 HASN'T SOME TIME OR OTHER WANTED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH 
03:06:11 THE MAYOR AND HAVE THE MAYOR LISTEN AND AT LEAST ENTERTAIN 
03:06:16 WHAT YOU THOUGHT AND WHAT YOU ASKED. I HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED 
03:06:24 AND I CONGRAT ULATE YOU. 
03:06:28 (APPLAUSE) 
03:06:35 >> ALDERMAN AUSTIN. 
03:06:39 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. IT SADDENS ME THIS WILL BE THE 
03:06:50 LAST TIME I WILL SAY, THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. I WANTED TO GO 
03:06:56 BACK TO SOMETHING THAT PAT SAID AND I CAUGHT MYSELF TEXTING 
03:07:03 BUT DON'T KNOW WHO THE HELL I WAS TEXTING TO SO I WOULDN'T CRY 
03:07:07 WHEN PAT WAS TALKING. MY FIRST HEARTFELT CONVERSATION WAS 
03:07:13 ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN. YOU SAID, CARRIE HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU 
03:07:20 HAVE AND I SAID TOO MANY TO COUNT. BUT THE IMPRESSION WAS 
03:07:24 WHEN I SAID I HAD 29 GRAND KIDS, YOU SAID HOW IN THE HELL DID 
03:07:30 YOU RAISE ALL OF THEM? I SAY WITH A IRON FIST. BECAUSE AT 
03:07:35 THAT TIME WHEN YOU CAME IN AS ALDERMAN O'CONNOR SAID, YOUR 
03:07:41 CHILDREN WAS THE MOST PRECIOUS GIFT COULD HAVE GIVEN YOU 
03:07:46 BESIDES AMY. I KNOW THAT ALL OF US WILL MISS YOU IN MANY 
03:07:53 DIFFERENT WAYS, BUT I WILL MISS YOU REALLY TALKING ABOUT YOUR 
03:07:58 KIDS, BECAUSE SOME OF US HAD A OPPORTUNITY TO WATCH YOU AND 
03:08:03 AMY RAISE THEM. BECAUSE THEY WERE THOSE SMALL KIDS WHEN THEY 
03:08:08 CAME IN AND NOW ALL MOST IN ADULT HOOD. I SAW YOU LIGHT UP 
03:08:14 WHEN YOUR DAUGHTER WENT TO COLLEGE AND SAW YOU CRY WHEN SHE 
03:08:18 WENT TO COLLEGE. THAT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT A FATHER AND I CAN 
03:08:23 SAY THAT WITHOUT FEAR OF CONTRA DICTION, YOU ARE A GREAT 
03:08:29 FATHER. I KNOW THAT FROM YOUR HARDHEADED CHILD NAMED ZACK. 
03:08:35 HARDHEADED AND IT TOOK YOUR HEART STRING WHEN SOMETHING 
03:08:41 DRASTIC HAPPENED TO HIM, BUT I SAW YOU CRY AND THANK GOD FOR 
03:08:48 ZACK BECAUSE YOU ARE A GREAT FATHER AS I SAID. I KNOW THAT 
03:08:58 THERE HAS BEEN TIME IN THE MARRIAGE THAT IT GOT A LITTLE 
03:09:05 ROUGH. I KNOW BECAUSE I HAD ONE OF THOSE TOO, BUT I KNOW THAT 
03:09:10 THERE WERE TIMES WHEN YOU COULD PUT YOUR HANDS IN YOUR FACE 
03:09:17 BUT YOU ALWAYS STOOD TALL EVEN THOUGH YOU SHORT. 
03:09:23 >> I GOT A BIG MOUTH. 
03:09:25 >> TRULY. BUT YOU STOOD TALL TO BRING ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT 
03:09:32 HAVE HAPPENED IN THIS CITY. YOU DIDN'T RUN FROM THEM, YOU 
03:09:38 STOOD VERY TALL. NOT ONLY JUST FOR YOUR CHILDREN, BUT FOR THE 
03:09:44 MANY CHILDREN IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO. WHEN YOU MADE ALL DAY 
03:09:48 KINDERGARTEN I COULD HAVE SHOUTED BECAUSE THAT HELPED EFFECT 
03:09:52 MY GRANDCHILDREN AND NOW MY GREAT GRANDCHILDREN. WHEN YOU 
03:09:59 OPEN UP THE DOORS OF COLLEGES IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO FOR YOUNG 
03:10:06 MEN AND WOMEN YOU OPENED UP THE DOORS FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN AND 
03:10:10 WILL BE MY GREAT GRANDCHILDREN. THOSE ARE MONUMENTAL THINGS 
03:10:17 YOU HAVE DONE THAT MAYBE SOMEBODY MIGHT NOT PAY ATTENTION TO 
03:10:21 BUT THEY ARE CLOSE TO MY HEART BECAUSE I CAN TELL THEM, I KNOW 
03:10:24 THE MAN THAT DID THIS FOR YOU. FOR THE YOUNG MEN IN OUR WARD 
03:10:30 AND AROUND THE CITY THAT I COME ENCOUNTER WITH THAT ARE IN 
03:10:35 COLLEGE NOW, THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY BEFORE BECAUSE 
03:10:40 WHAT DID YOU SAY? OTHER CHILDREN NEED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY 
03:10:44 THAT MY CHILDREN HAVE. AMY, I'M GOING TO MISS NOT HAVING 
03:10:54 FIRST LADIES LUNCHEON. IT BROUGHT SUCH A DELIGHT TO SO MANY 
03:10:58 OF THE WOMEN IN MY WARD TO HAVE YOU THERE AND TO BE ABLE TO 
03:11:03 BREAK BREAD WITH YOU. I'LL MISS THAT, BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE 
03:11:09 PASTOR WIVES, SO MANY OF THE LEADERS IN OUR WARD GOT A 
03:11:13 OPPORTUNITY TO JUST SIT DOWN WITH YOU. EVEN THOUGH YOUR 
03:11:19 HUSBAND WAS THE MAYOR, YOU WERE THE MOST PRECIOUS PERSON IN 
03:11:24 THE ROOM AND WE THANK YOU FOR THAT. 
03:11:30 (APPLAUSE) 
03:12:02 YOU ARE MORE DESERVING OF THOSE APPLAUSE, MORE THEN DESERVING, 
03:12:08 BUT FOR THE WOMEN THAT IS IN THIS COUNCIL AND I KNOW THEY WILL 
03:12:11 SPEAK ALSO, ON BEHALF OF A MAN THAT I GAVE RESPECT TO WITHOUT 
03:12:23 EVEN KNOWING THAT AND THAT IS MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL. I WANT TO 
03:12:26 THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU DID GIVE TO ME. ALSO, 
03:12:32 I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE YOUR BUDGET 
03:12:36 CHAIRMAN. I TOLD YOU WHEN YOU CAME IN THE DOOR, I'LL BE YOUR 
03:12:41 NUMBER 1, GO FIND NUMBER 2. 
03:12:44 THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH, MR. MAYOR. 
03:12:50 (APPLAUSE) 
03:12:51 >> ALDERMAN LORENO. 
03:12:58 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. I ALSO RISE TO SUPPORT THE 
03:13:04 RESOLUTION. MR. PRESIDENT, PLEASE ALLOW ME TO SHARE MY 
03:13:08 THOUGHTS WITH COUNCIL ON OUR RELATIONSHIP. I HAD NO IDEA THAT 
03:13:13 ONE DAY I WOULD BE FRIENDS WITH RAHM EMANUEL. IT DIDN'T SEEM 
03:13:18 POSSIBLE. WHEN I FIRST MET HIM, HE WAS AS ALDERMAN O'CONNOR 
03:13:24 MENTIONED, THE NORTHWEST SIDE "PREFERRED CANDIDATE FOR 
03:13:31 CONGRESS" AND HIS REPUTATION AS THE NO HOLDS BARRED, TAKE NO 
03:13:41 PRISONERS LEADERSHIP STYLE THAT EARNED THE NAME RAHMBO 
03:13:46 PROCEEDED HIM AND IT WAS FRIGHTENING. ONE OF THE FIRST EVENTS 
03:13:49 WE WENT TO WAS AT A BOHEMIAN CEMETERY AND YOU CAME WITH YOUR 
03:13:56 FAMILY WITH AMY AND THE CHILDREN WAS SMALL AND IT WAS A 
03:14:02 MEMORIAL DAY EVENT THAT WE HAD A BLAST AND HOPE YOUR CHILDREN 
03:14:05 ENJOYED IT AS LITTLE AS THEY WERE. THEY WERE PRETTY WELL 
03:14:10 BEHAVED. AS I GOT OUT TO LEARN MORE I FOUND HE HAD A SOFT AND 
03:14:18 GENTLE SIDE. I READ A ARTICLE WHERE HIS BROTHER WAS QUOTED 
03:14:23 SAYING RAHM WAS A QUITE OBSERVANT CHILD. I THINK RAHM, MEANS 
03:14:28 HIGH AND LOFTY IN HEBREW AND HE SOARED TO HIGH AND LOFTY 
03:14:36 PLACES NOT ONLY IN POLITICS BUT PROBABLY WITH YOUR BALLET 
03:14:44 TRAINING. I THINK THE SOFT AND GENTLE SIDE WAS PUT ASIDE 
03:14:47 YOUNGER AND [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER THE 
03:14:50 STORY WHERE PRESIDENT OBAMA ONCE STATED THAT THE ACCIDENT 
03:14:58 RENDERED RAHM PRACTICALLY MUTE BUT SUSPECT THE ACCIDENT WAS A 
03:15:07 [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] RESULTED IN THE RELEASE OF THIS VIBRANT 
03:15:09 AND IMAGINATIVE THOUGHT PROCESS AND PEOPLE KEEP ASKING ME, 
03:15:16 WHAT IS RAHM EMANUEL GOING TO DO AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 
03:15:20 NEXT MOVE WILL BE. BUT I SUS SPECT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE LAST 
03:15:24 OF HIM. AT LEAST I HOPE WE HAVEN'T. PERHAPS HE'LL BE A TV 
03:15:33 TALKING HEAD OR WRITE A BOOK WHICH I EXPECT TO BE IN IT OR 
03:15:39 MAYBE COMPETE ON DANCING WITH THE STARS, BUT WHATEVER IT IS- 
03:15:43 >> ONLY IF YOU ARE MY DANCE PARTNER. 
03:15:45 >> WHATEVER IT IS, I KNOW HE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AND THAT WILL 
03:15:49 CONTINUE AND HE'LL CONTINUE MAKING A DIFFERENCE. I LEARNED A 
03:15:53 LOT FROM THE MAYOR OVER THE YEARS AND ONE THING IS YES, AN 
03:15:57 EXPANDED VOCABULARY. I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE PROBABLY THINKING 
03:16:01 BUT WE ARE NOT GOING THERE. HERE ARE GOES, MR. MAYOR, KNOW 
03:16:07 THAT WE'RE HOVELING, BUT I'LL WRAP THIS UP BEFORE WE START 
03:16:15 SHAVETTING AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 8 YEARS OF LEADERSHIP 
03:16:19 AND OUR MANY MANY YEARS OF FRIENDSHIP. THANK YOU. 
03:16:23 >> THANK YOU. 
03:16:25 (APPLAUSE) 
03:16:31 YOU GET A A FOR EFFORT. ALDERMAN MICHELE HARRIS. 
03:16:36 >> THANK YOU MR. HARRIS. I RISE BE ASSOCIATE WOULD THE 
03:16:41 RESOLUTION. I WANT TO START MY REMARKS WITH AMY BECAUSE FROM 
03:16:44 THE VERY BEGINNING YOU HAVE OPENED UP THE NOT JUST ME BUT TO 
03:16:48 THE CITY A VERY PERSONAL WAY. YOU HAVE BEEN THERE, ALLOWED 
03:16:56 PEOPLE TO SEE YOU, TOUCH YOU AND FEEL YOU AND THAT IS SO 
03:16:59 IMPORTANT. YOU CANT REALIZE WHAT THAT MEANS TO COMMUNITIES OF 
03:17:04 PEOPLE FOR YOU TO BE THERE AND BE INVOLVED SO I'M GRATEFUL FOR 
03:17:09 YOU AND NOT ALWAYS MAKING IT ABOUT THE CITY. THERE ARE 
03:17:15 CONVERSATIONS ABOUT OTHER THINGS AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE 
03:17:17 CITY OF CHICAGO SO FROM MY HEART TO YOUR HEART I CANNOT TELL 
03:17:22 YOU HOW I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO YOUR HUSBAND AND CITY 
03:17:25 OF CHICAGO SO AGAIN, THANK YOU. NOW, I GOT MY OWN STORY, MR. 
03:17:31 MAYOR ABOUT HOW I GOT TO YOU BECAUSE I'M NOT LIKE-I'M SCARED 
03:17:35 OF EVERYBODY AND PEOPLE KNOW THAT. I'M AFRAID OF EVERYTHING. 
03:17:39 I'M JUST GETTING USED TO [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] I'M JUST GETTING 
03:17:45 USED TO MAYOR DALEY AND TALKING WITH SAM AND LIKE, I DON'T 
03:17:48 KNOW HIM AND WHAT TO EXPECT. I WAS LIKE I KNOW MAYOR DALEY 
03:17:52 BUT DON'T KNOW RAHM EMANUEL. SAM SAYS NO PROBLEM, I'LL TAKE 
03:17:56 YOU IN AND FROM THIS DAY HE TAKES CREDIT FOR EVERYTHING I DO 
03:17:59 AND SO HE BRINGS ME IN AND I'M SITTING THERE AND LIKE, STILL 
03:18:03 SCARED TO DEATH. IT IS GOING TO BE REALLY DIFFERENT. SO, 
03:18:07 FROM DAY ONE I GOT TO SAY IT WANT REAL DIFFERENT THAT YOU 
03:18:12 THEN-YOU FROM THAT DAY TO 8 YEARS FROM NOW THE SAME YOU I MET 
03:18:18 AND SAT IN A ROOM AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT MY ISSUES WERE AND 
03:18:23 WHAT YOU FELT THE DIRECTION OF THE CITY WOULD GO IN. I CAN'T 
03:18:26 THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR BEING THE SAME YOU THAT YOU WERE 8 YEARS 
03:18:30 TO THE SAME YOU THAT YOU ARE NOW 8 YEARS LATER, AND HOW 
03:18:35 REMARKABLE YOUR LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN IN TERMS OF MOVING THE 
03:18:39 CITY FORWARD, LISTENING TO ALL THE ISSUES NOT JUST MINE, 
03:18:44 SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE I GOT YOU ON PERSONAL SPEED DIAL- 
03:18:48 >> THAT MAKES TWO OF US. 
03:18:50 >> I CALL YOU AT 10 O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND LIKE, I'M SORRY IT IS 
03:18:54 SO LATE. BUT THANK YOU FOR TAKING THOSE CRAZY CALLS. 
03:18:57 LISTENING TO WHAT MY ISSUES WERE AND THEN NOT JUST LISTENING 
03:19:04 BUT HELPING WE GET TO A POINT TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE AND NEVER 
03:19:09 LEAVING ME BEHIND SO I CAN'T APPRECIATE MORE YOUR LEADERSHIP 
03:19:13 AND FRIENDSHIP AND IT HAS BECOME A FRIENDSHIP OVER 8 YEARS AND 
03:19:17 I TRULY CONSIDER YOU A FRIEND AND NOT JUST THE MAYOR OF THE 
03:19:24 CITY OF CHICAGO BECAUSE IT EVOLVED. I THANK YOU FOR MOVING 
03:19:30 THE ISSUES OF THE COMMUNITY FORWARD AND HOPE FOREVER AS LONG 
03:19:38 AS YOU ARE HERE WE WILL HAVE A WONDERFUL FRIENDSHIP. 
03:19:46 >> ALDERMAN BEALE. 
03:19:47 >> I TOO RISE TO SUPPORT THE RESOLUTION AND LIKE MY COLLEAGUES 
03:19:51 ALDERMAN HARRIS I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE FIRST LADY FOR 
03:19:54 ALLOWING US TO BORROW OUR MAYOR FOR 8 YEARS. WE KNOW IT IS 
03:20:01 TOUCH ON ANYBODY WHO IS HOLDING THE HOUSEHOLD DOWN SO WE WANT 
03:20:06 TO MAKE SURE WE LIFT YOU UP FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE TO 
03:20:09 PUT UP WITH NOT HIM BUT ALL OF US. I DO HAVE A FIRST LADY 
03:20:16 STORY FOR YOU. LAST YEAR SOME OF YOU ALL KNOW WE WERE IN THE 
03:20:19 CITY CHAMPIONSHIP AT WRIGLEY FIELD AND I CALLED THE MAYOR TO 
03:20:23 COME OUT AND THROW OUT THE FIRST PITCH AND HE SAID THERE IS NO 
03:20:27 WAY-I CAN'T THROW. HE SAID BUT I GOT SOMEBODY FOR YOU AND HE 
03:20:31 SENT THE FIRST LADY OUT. 
03:20:33 HE SENT THE FIRST LADY OUT AND I CAN TELL YOU I HAVE IT ON 
03:20:40 CAMERA. SHE THROUGH A STRIKE RIGHT DOWN THE PIPE. THANK YOU 
03:20:44 SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE DONE AND AGAIN, WHATEVER 
03:20:51 THE FUTURE HAS FOR YOU ALL, WE THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF 
03:20:56 OUR HEART ALLOWING HIM TO SERVE WITH US. MR. PRESIDENT, MANY 
03:21:02 OF YOU KNOW WE HAD LONG FIGHTS, BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU, THE 
03:21:09 FIGHTS I HAD WITH THIS MAYOR WAS FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THIS 
03:21:16 CITY AND IT WASN'T A CONTENTIOUS FIGHT, IT WAS A FIGHT ON HOW 
03:21:19 WE CAN GET TO THE END RESULT AND YOU ALL MAY HAVE KNOWN WHEN 
03:21:24 WE HAD THE RIDE SHARE ISSUE, WE FOUGHT BUT IT WAS NEVER A 
03:21:29 CONTENTIOUS FIGHT, IT WAS JUST HOW TO GET TO THE END RESULT AS 
03:21:32 FAR AS WHAT IS BEST FOR THIS ENTIRE CITY. THAT IS NOT THE 
03:21:38 ONLY FIGHT WE HAD. THE MAYOR HAS BROUGHT SO MUCH DEVELOPMENT 
03:21:42 TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO AND I SAY AGAIN, HE BROUGHT SO 
03:21:47 MUCH DEVELOPMENT TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO. 
03:21:50 (APPLAUSE) 
03:21:53 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE 
03:22:01 OF COMING TO THE SOUTH SIDE I ALWAYS JOKED WITH THE MAYOR AND 
03:22:06 SAID EVERYTHING TIME HE CAME FAR SOUTH DID HE PUNCH HIS 
03:22:11 FREQUENT FLIER MILES BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH HE WAS COMING TO THE 
03:22:15 SOUTH SIDE. THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW HIS DEDICATION TO BRINGING 
03:22:19 JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ALL PARTS OF THE CITY. I THINK IT 
03:22:24 WAS UNFAIR FOR PEOPLE TO LABEL HIM AS THE MAYOR 1 PERCENT WHEN 
03:22:29 EVERY TIME I SAW HIM COMING OUT TO THE SOUTH SIDE AND WEST 
03:22:32 SIDE TO BRING SERVICES AND GOODS THAT'S THE MAYOR FOR THE 
03:22:36 ENTIRE CITY. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF JOBS THAT HAVE BEEN 
03:22:42 CREATED IN MY WARD ALONE I CAN TESTIFY TO AND TELL YOU EACH 
03:22:48 JOB THAT CAME TO THE AREA WE TAG TEAMED EACH AND EVERY ONE 
03:22:54 THAT CAME TO THE WARD. WHOLE FOOD. WE CONVINCED WHOLE FOOD 
03:22:58 TO COME TO INDIANA AND BRING THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO THE 
03:23:06 SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO. YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST MANUFACTURING 
03:23:13 COMPANY TO THE SOUTH SIDE IN OVER 30 YEARS. THAT WASN'T BY 
03:23:17 ACCIDENT. METHOD LOOKED AT 40 SITES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY 
03:23:22 AND CHOSE THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO. LOOK AT GOTHAM GREENS 
03:23:27 THE FIRST AND LARGEST GREEN HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY THAT SITS ON 
03:23:33 TOP OF METHOD. LARGEST GREEN HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY AND THEY 
03:23:38 ARE NOW DOUBLING DOWN BUILDING ANOTHER GREEN HOUSE JUST 
03:23:41 ADJACENT TO THAT PROPERTY BECAUSE THEY ARE DOING SO WELL. WE 
03:23:44 HAVE THE FIRST AND THE SECOND LARGEST INDOOR GREEN HOUSES IN 
03:23:47 THE COUNTRY ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO. JOBS AND 
03:23:52 OPPORTUNITY. FRESH PRODUCE THAT YOU CAN'T GET ANYWHERE ELSE. 
03:23:57 WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE LEGACY OF THIS MAYOR, I ATTEST TO 
03:24:03 THE THINGS HE HELPED ME WITH IN MY WARD AND COMMUNITY TO MAKE 
03:24:08 MY COMMUNITY A BETTER PLACE. NOW, THE ONE THING THAT TOPS ALL 
03:24:11 THE ICING ON IT CAKE AND SORRY SOME OF YOU CAN BE JEALOUS, BUT 
03:24:15 IT IS HOW IT IS, BUT TO BRING A MUSEUM TO THE PRESIDENT BRING 
03:24:28 A NATIONAL PARK WITH A NEW MUSEUM TO BE OPENING UP THAT IS 
03:24:33 BECAUSE THIS MAYOR PUT A CALL INTO BARACK OBAMA AND SAID WE 
03:24:37 NEED TO PRESERVE THE LEGACY AND HISTORY OF [INAUDIBLE 
03:24:42 COMMENTS] DESIGNATING IT AS A NATIONAL MONUMENT. THAT IS THE 
03:24:47 SECOND NATIONAL PARK IN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS THAT IS BRINGING 
03:24:51 HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TOURISTS TO THE SOUTH SIDE. WITH 
03:24:56 THAT WE KNOW CONGRESS DOESN'T HAVE MONEY, BUT THE MAYOR HELPED 
03:25:01 RAISE $10 MILLION TO JUMP START THAT DEVELOPMENT TO WHERE 
03:25:06 TOURIST CAN START COMING TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO AND HAVE 
03:25:09 THE POOLMAN AREA AS A DESTINATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS A 
03:25:13 NATIONAL PARK. SO, THAT'S SOMEBODY WHO IS TRANSFORMING MY 
03:25:19 COMMUNITY, HELPING ME TRANSFORM MY COMMUNITY. MR. MAYOR, THAT 
03:25:25 IS JUST A TIP OF THE ICEBERG. I CAN GO ON BUT DON'T WANT TO 
03:25:28 BE HERE ALL DAY, BECAUSE-I'M GOING TO TURN THE PAGE NOW. 
03:25:38 [LAUGHTER] 
03:25:40 BECAUSE I GOT A LOT MORE. MR. MAYOR, I JUST WANT TO LET YOU 
03:25:46 KNOW FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 
03:25:50 DOING EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE TO HELP ME IN MY COMMUNITY. IT 
03:25:54 WASN'T BY CHANCE. WE DIDN'T KNOW YOU ON THE SOUTH SIDE. WE 
03:26:00 KNEW OF YOU BUT DIDN'T KNOW YOU BUT WHEN YOU PULLED US BEFORE 
03:26:03 YOU WERE SWORN AND SAID HOW CAN I HELP YOU, WHAT ARE YOUR 
03:26:06 PRIORITIES, YOU DELIVERED. YOU DELIVERED ON THE RED LINE 
03:26:12 UPGRADE AND RED LINE EXTENSION IS IN THE WORKS. THE 95TH 
03:26:17 STREET STATION THAT IS BECAUSE OF YOUR VISION SO THANK YOU FOR 
03:26:20 HELPING US TRANSFORM THE SOUTH SIDE. THANK YOU, MR. 
03:26:24 PRESIDENT. 
03:26:25 >> THANK YOU. 
03:26:26 (APPLAUSE) 
03:26:27 >> ALDERMAN SCOTT. 
03:26:31 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. I TOO RISE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH 
03:26:34 THIS RESOLUTION. SO, ALDERMAN O'CONNOR TALKED ABOUT HOW HEW 
03:26:43 KNEW THE MAYOR BEFORE HE GOT TO KNOW HIM PERSONALLY. I HAVE A 
03:26:48 SIMILAR STORY. PEOPLE MAY HAVE HEARD THIS-WE JOKE ABOUT THIS 
03:26:54 QUITE OFTEN BUT I CONSIDER MR. MAYOR A RESIDENT OF THE WEST 
03:26:58 SIDE OF CHICAGO AND THAT IS BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN, 
03:27:03 HE GREW UP ON THE CORNER OF DOUGLAS AND CENTRAL PARK IN MY 
03:27:08 GREAT AUNT HOUSE SO MY GREAT AUNT WAS HIS CARE TAKER AND WOULD 
03:27:17 HE GETS ARRESTED ALL THE TIME SO HAD TO SPEND NIGHTS AND 
03:27:21 NIGHTS AT MY GREAT AUNTS HOW SO I LOOK AT MR. MAYOR AS A PLAY 
03:27:27 COUSIN IF YOU WILL BECAUSE WE-I LIKE TO CALL HIM A WEST SIDER. 
03:27:32 THAT RELATIONSHIP AND THAT BOND I THINK HAS GROWN AS I BECAME 
03:27:38 ALDERMAN OF THE 24TH WARD. I LIKE MANY OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES 
03:27:45 CONSIDER YOU A FRIEND. YOU HAVE BEEN A MAN OF YOUR WORD. THE 
03:27:51 FIRST DAY THAT I WAS ELECTED GOT A CALL FROM YOU AND SAID YOU 
03:27:54 COME TO MY OFFICE AND SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT YOUR PRIORITIES. 
03:27:58 LET'S TALK ABOUT ROOSEVELT ROAD AND HOW TO GET MORE 
03:28:01 INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE NEW GROCERY STORE AND LET'S TALK ABOUT 
03:28:04 THE LAND ON [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] ROOSEVELT YOU ARE TRYING TO 
03:28:07 DEVELOP AND TO YOUR WORD EVERYTHING I PUT BEFORE YOU HAS BEEN 
03:28:11 A PRIORITY TO THIS ADMINISTRATION. I LIKE TO SAY THAT IN THE 
03:28:15 LAST 4 YEARS WE HAVE DONE MORE WORK THEN IS DONE IN THE 24TH 
03:28:20 WARD IN THE LAST 20 AND THAT ISN'T ALL BECAUSE OF THE ALDERMAN 
03:28:24 THAT IS THERE, THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND YOUR 
03:28:27 CARING FOR THE WEST SIDE OF CHICAGO AND THE 24TH WARD. I AM-I 
03:28:34 WOULD BE REMISS TO NOT TALK ABOUT THE LOVE YOU HAVE FOR YOUR 
03:28:37 WIFE. THE FIRST WEEK BEFORE WE WERE ELECTED AND WORN IN YOU 
03:28:46 INVITED MY WIFE AND I TO A LUNCH MEETING WITH ALDERMAN IRVING 
03:28:52 AND TREASURER ELECT [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] AND YOUR WIFE WAS SO 
03:28:56 GRACIOUS TO ME AND MY WIFE. SINCE THAT DAY EVERY TIME YOU SEE 
03:29:00 MY WIFE OR YOUR WIFE SEES MY WIFE YOU ARE SO KIND TO HER AND 
03:29:05 THAT IS SO VERY IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE I KNOW I'M OFF DOING 
03:29:08 THE WORK OF THE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO 
03:29:10 HAVE SUPPORT AROUND YOU AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE GREAT 
03:29:13 PEOPLE AROUND YOU SO I APPRECIATE YOU BEING SO KIND TO MY WIFE 
03:29:19 AND FAMILY. THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, I 
03:29:24 EXPECT YOU TO DO-YOU ARE SAYING YOU ARE LEAVING BUT DONT THINK 
03:29:27 YOU WILL GO VERY FAR. I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO GO VERY FAR. I 
03:29:31 WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE THIS BOND AND WE WILL BE 
03:29:34 FAMILY LONG AFTER THE WAYS WHEN YOU ARE NOT MAYOR HERE IN THE 
03:29:39 CITY OF CHICAGO, BUT I LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR DEDICATION 
03:29:43 AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO THINKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX AND DOING 
03:29:45 THINGS THAT OTHER MAYORS MAY HAVE BEEN AFRAID TO DO. MY 
03:29:50 FATHER WAS PART OF A ADMINISTRATION BEFORE AND I LOVE THEM AND 
03:29:57 I APPRECIATE ALL THEY HAVE DONE FOR THE CITY OF CHICAGO BUT 
03:30:00 YOU HAVE FORCED US AND THE COUNCIL TO TAKE A LOT OF TOUGH 
03:30:04 VOTES THAT WE ORDINARILY WOULD NOT WANT TO HAVE TAKEN BUT I 
03:30:08 THINK IT IS FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE CITY AND THINK IT IS 
03:30:11 BECAUSE OF YOU AND YOUR LEADERSHIP SO I THANK YOU FOR THAT AND 
03:30:13 THANK YOU FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE CITY. 
03:30:17 >> ALDERMAN REBOYRAS. 
03:30:19 THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. I SAY THANK YOU RAHM, BUT HOW DO YOU 
03:30:27 SAY GOOD BYE TO SOMEONE THAT IS PART OF CHICAGO? VERY 
03:30:32 DIFFICULT. LIKE THE COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY, IT IS SAD THAT 
03:30:36 SOME ARE LEAVING BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE SO MUCH AND WE 
03:30:40 APPRECIATE A LOT OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. I BELIEVE YOU SAY 
03:30:48 FAREWELL AND WE WILL MEET AGAIN. I DON'T THINK THAT WILL 
03:30:52 CHANGE. THE JOB THAT YOU DID FOR CHICAGO WAS NOT ONLY 
03:30:59 IMPECCABLE, BUT HISTORIC AS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE STATED. 
03:31:04 YOU HAVE TAKEN US TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL. I REMEMBER ALSO AS 
03:31:10 PAT STATED EARLIER, SATURDAY MORNING MEETING AT A RESTAURANT, 
03:31:18 WESTERN AND FULLERTON. DONT KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THAT. I SAT 
03:31:20 ACROSS FROM YOU AND SEVERAL FOLKS PRIOR TO YOU RUNNING FOR 
03:31:23 CONGRESS, AND WE HAD BREAKFAST AND GETS UP AND LEAVE AND 
03:31:26 THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO PICK UP THE TAB. HERE WE GO, WE ARE 
03:31:32 WORKING AND CONGRESSMAN. SAYS A LOT FOR YOURSELF. TO RUN FOR 
03:31:41 CONGRESS, WORK WITH OUR PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THEN THERE IS 
03:31:45 SOMETHING MISSING SO GOES BACK TO THE CITY OF CHICAGO TO DO 
03:31:50 NOT ONLY A YEOMAN'S JOB BUT A IMPECCABLE JOB. I THINK WE'LL 
03:31:56 ALL MISS THAT. I REMEMBER US CROSSING OTHER IN THE HALLWAY 
03:32:04 ONE DAY AND HE DOESN'T CALL ME AERIAL, HE CALLED ME [INAUDIBLE 
03:32:08 COMMENTS] THAT DAY HE CALLED [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] TRUE STORY. 
03:32:15 I THINK HE REMEMBERS THAT. WE HAD TO WORK FOR THAT. I 
03:32:22 BELIEVE WE HAVE UNDER YOUR DIRECTION WE HAVE WORKED. WE HAVE 
03:32:27 GONE TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL, MAYOR IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO. WE 
03:32:34 ALL HERE TODAY ARE RECIPIENTS OF MANY PARKS, MANY SCHOOLS, 
03:32:39 AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. THE SUMMER YOUTH PROGRAM IS NOT ONLY 
03:32:41 INCREASING EVERY YEAR AND WE THANK YOU FOR THAT, BUT THEN WE 
03:32:45 HAVE FIRST LADY AMY WHO IS ALSO A TOUGH INDIVIDUAL. BUT THE 
03:32:54 FACT IS THAT WE ALL HAVE FAMILIES AND THAT YOU DEDICATED 7 
03:33:00 DAYS A WEEK TO THIS JOB. SAYS A LOT FOR YOU AND THE SUPPORT 
03:33:05 YOU HAD FROM THE FIRST LADY. I BELIEVE WE'LL ALL MISS THAT. 
03:33:11 I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO CHAIR THE COMMITTEE ON 
03:33:15 PUBLIC SAFETY AT A VERY VERY SENSITIVE AND DIFFICULT TIME IN 
03:33:19 THE CITY OF CHICAGO. I LEARNED A LOT AND I THANK YOU FOR 
03:33:23 THAT. WE'LL CONTINUE DOING THAT. I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT 
03:33:31 YOU WILL BE MISSED, BUT I KNOW ALL OF OUR PATHS WILL CROSS 
03:33:35 AGAIN AND I THANK YOU. 
03:33:41 (APPLAUSE) 
03:33:42 >> ALDERMAN CAPPLEMAN. 
03:33:44 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. I TOO RISE-I COULD MENTION THE 
03:33:51 [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] UPTOWN THEATER, I DON'T NEED TO BECAUSE 
03:33:54 THAT IS IMPORTANT AS THAT WAS FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND HOW IT 
03:33:59 TRANSFORMED IT INCREDIBLY BEYOND MY WILDEST DREAMS. THERE IS 
03:34:04 SOMETHING ELSE THAT STOOD OUT TO ME, AND I SEE IT EVERY TIME 
03:34:07 WE HAVE CITY COUNCIL WHEN WE HONOR CHILDREN. YOU ALWAYS MAKE 
03:34:12 IT A POINT TO HONOR THE PARENTS. WHEN I WORKED AT TWO 
03:34:19 DIFFERENT CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS. [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] 
03:34:23 CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IT WAS REINFORCED OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT 
03:34:26 WHEN YOU ENTER A CHILD'S ROOM YOU FIRST INTERACT WITH THE 
03:34:31 PARENTS, AND YOU MAKE SURE THAT THE PARENTS KNOW AND YOU 
03:34:38 REAFFIRM THEY ARE THE PROVIDER, PROTECTOR AND NURTURER OF 
03:34:41 THEIR CHILDREN AND WHEN YOU DO THAT EVERY TIME AND YOU DID IT 
03:34:47 THIS MORNING, IT'S ALSO REMINDING PARENTS THAT THEY HAD THAT 
03:34:54 ROLE AND THEY MUST KEEP THAT ROLE. AS ALDERMAN I OFTEN TIMES 
03:35:00 WHEN I LOOK AT THINGS THAT I NEED TO SEE HAPPEN IN THE 46TH 
03:35:04 WARD AND THROUGHOUT THE CITY I THINK BACK ON IS THIS GOING TO 
03:35:08 SUPPORT A MOM OR DAD'S ROLE AS THE PARENT OF THEIR CHILDREN 
03:35:14 AND THAT'S MY GUIDING LIGHT THAT I USE. THAT'S MY LITMUS 
03:35:22 TEST. THERE IS ONE OTHER THING THAT REALLY STRIKES ME. IN 
03:35:27 2012 I WENT TO HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL OF GOVERNMENT. LEADERS 
03:35:31 FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD WERE THERE AND WE TALKED IN 2012 THAT 
03:35:36 WE ARE ENTERING A AGE OF EXTREME POLARIZATION WHERE SIDES ARE 
03:35:42 ALL FIGHTING WITH ONE ANOTHER, AND THEY TALKED AND THEY-IT WAS 
03:35:47 ALSO MENTIONED THAT POLARIZATION IS GOING TO INCREASE AND IT 
03:35:51 HAS INCREASED. BUT IT TALKED ABOUT THE NEED THAT WHEN WE 
03:35:57 NEGOTIATE WE OFTEN TIMES GET STUCK IN A WIN LOSE AND SOMETIMES 
03:36:03 THERE ARE WIN LOSE NEGOTIATIONS THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE WE ARE ALL 
03:36:07 HUMANS. BUT YOU HAVE STEADFASTLY FOCUSED ON MAKING WIN, WIN 
03:36:15 NEGOTIATIONS AND THAT HAS BEEN POWERFUL. THAT IS MUCH MUCH 
03:36:18 MORE DIFFICULT BUT THAT REALLY DISPLAYS THE LEADER THAT YOU 
03:36:23 HAVE BEEN AND I REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND I LOOK FORWARD 
03:36:27 WORKING WITH YOU MORE. THANK YOU. 
03:36:29 >> ALDERMAN BURNETT. 
03:36:33 (APPLAUSE) 
03:36:34 >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. PRESIDENT. I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT 
03:36:39 OF THIS RESOLUTION. BEEN CONTEMPLATING FOR A WHILE WHAT I WAS 
03:36:50 GOING TO SAY WHEN I GOT UP HERE. I DESCRIBE TO YOU A COUPLE 
03:36:57 THINGS TO DESCRIBE TO YOU AS A NURTURER, A PUSHER, A 
03:37:04 [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] MY HEBREW HOMEY, SOMEONE WHO HELPED ME TO 
03:37:15 GET EXPERIENCE OF NOT JUST REPRESENTING MY WARD, BUT THE 
03:37:21 FEELING OF REPRESENTING THE WHOLE CITY OF CHICAGO. WITH 
03:37:26 HELPING ME TO BRING LARGE CORPORATIONS TO MY WARD LIKE GOOGLE 
03:37:30 AND MCDONALDS AND GROUPON AND WRIGGLY AND KRAFT AND SO MANY 
03:37:39 OTHERS. THEY ALWAYS HATING, MAN. 
03:37:47 [LAUGHTER] 
03:37:49 >> HATING ON YOU NOW. 
03:37:52 >> YEAH. ALSO, WITH PUSHING THE BULLS TO BRING THE PRACTICE 
03:37:59 CENTER TO CHICAGO. PUSHING TO BRING THE BLACK HAWKS PRACTICE 
03:38:03 CENTER TO CHICAGO. YOU KNOW, TAKING THE LEVERAGE AND DOLLARS 
03:38:10 FROM DEVELOPERS TO DO THE NEIGHBORHOOD OPPORTUNITY FUND, I 
03:38:16 MEAN LUCKY I'M YOUR FRIEND BECAUSE MOST OF THE MONEY FIRST OF 
03:38:19 ALL CAME FROM MY WARD, BUT I UNDERSTAND THE BIGGER PICTURE. 
03:38:26 THE BIGGER PICTURE WAS TO HELP THE WHOLE CITY OF CHICAGO. YOU 
03:38:33 DIDN'T JUST CARE ABOUT DOWNTOWN, DIDN'T JUST CARE ABOUT THE 
03:38:36 CENTRAL AREA, BUT YOU AND I-I CARED ABOUT THE WEST SIDE AND 
03:38:41 THE SOUTH SIDE. SO, EVEN SOME OF THE COMMUNITY FOLKS ARE LIKE 
03:38:49 WHEY ARE YOU TAKING FROM OUR SIDE BUT YOU HAD A BIGGER VISION 
03:38:53 AND PICTURE TAKING CARE OF THE BROADER CITY OF CHICAGO. ONE 
03:38:57 THING THAT GET ME IS THAT I ALWAYS HAVE TO DEFEND YOU IS THAT 
03:39:02 PEOPLE DONT WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE STUFF THAT YOU DO OR HAVE 
03:39:06 DONE. ONE JUST IN THE CITY COUNCIL-I MEAN IN THE CITY HALL, 
03:39:12 WE HAVE MORE AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CHARGE OF DEPARTMENTS THEN 
03:39:17 WE EVER HAD IN HISTORY. WE GOT A AFRICAN AMERICAN POLICE 
03:39:29 SUPER INTENDANT, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, BUDGET DIRECTOR, 
03:39:34 HEAD OF SEWER AND WATER. I CAN GO ON AND ON. SO MANY WOMEN 
03:39:39 HAVE GOTTEN LEADERSHIP ROLES THAT I KNOW YOU CAME OUT OF 
03:39:46 THE -WHEN YOU FIRST CAME HERE THE MEDIA BEAT YOU UP SO BAD 
03:39:50 THEY WERE ALL OVER YOU AND HAVEN'T LET YOU GO. THEY DIDN'T 
03:39:54 WANT TO RECOGNIZE ALL THESE THINGS YOU HAVE DONE IN OUR 
03:39:57 COMMUNITY. MY FIRST MEETING WITH YOU BECAUSE I DIDN'T SUPPORT 
03:40:01 YOU WHEN YOU FIRST RAN, MY FIRST MEETING WITH YOU YOU CALLED 
03:40:06 ME, WHICH I APPRECIATED, I WAS SHOCKED. [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] 
03:40:10 CALLED ME UP AND SAID THE MAYOR WANT TO THE MEET WITH YOU, AND 
03:40:15 I WENT TO THE MEETING AND I SAID, THE FIRST THING I SAID, I 
03:40:21 SAID LOOK MAN, I DONT WANT TO HAVE TO FIGHT WITH YOU LIKE I 
03:40:25 HAD TO FIGHT WITH MAYOR DALEY WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND YOU 
03:40:30 STUCK OUT YOUR CHEST AND SAID I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT WITH YOU 
03:40:35 EITHER. YOU SAID I GOT DIFFERENT IDEAS AND I GOT TO TELL YOU 
03:40:38 YOU WORKED WITH ME ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YOU HELPED ME 
03:40:42 EXPAND MY [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] ORDINANCE. YOU STOOD WITH US 
03:40:47 WHEN WE FOUGHT TO SAVE S R O'S WHICH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HELP 
03:40:57 SO MANY PEOPLE AND COME UP TO ME ON THE STREET AND BE LIKE 
03:41:06 MAN, I LOVE MY APARTMENT. AND I APPRECIATE THAT. YOU HELPED 
03:41:19 ME TO EXPAND AND CONTINUE MY CHA. [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] AND 
03:41:27 ROCKWELL. IT HAD BEEN OFF FOR A WHILE LIKE THE ALDERMAN SAID. 
03:41:35 I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO MORE IN THE PAST 8 YEARS THEN I HAVE 
03:41:38 BEEN ABLE TO DO IN MY 24 YEARS IN MY WARD. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE 
03:41:44 TO DO SO MANY THINGS. WHEN I CAME UP TO YOU ABOUT WITH 
03:41:50 ADVOCATES ABOUT HELPING EX OFFENDERS TO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN 
03:41:58 PARTS OF PUBLIC HOUSING WHICH YOU DON'T GET RECOGNITION ABOUT, 
03:42:02 YOU JUMPED RIGHT ON IT. WHEN WE CAME WITH TO YOU TO ABOUT NOT 
03:42:10 CHECKING THE BOX FOR EX OFFENDERS YOU PUT ALL YOUR POLICY 
03:42:16 PEOPLE ON IT AND MADE IT HAPPEN. YOU HAVE DONE SO MUCH IN THE 
03:42:21 CITY TO HELP ALL PEOPLE. NEXT MAYOR GOING TO HAVE BIG SHOES 
03:42:31 TO FILL. AFTER THEY GET HERE AND SEE SOME OF THE WORDS THAT I 
03:42:37 DIDN'T USE TO DESCRIBE YOU IS A HUSTLER. YOU A HUSTLER, MAN, 
03:42:42 IN A GOOD WAY. YOU ARE A HUSTLER. THE WAY YOU HAVE HUSTLED 
03:42:49 CORPORATIONS TO DO WHAT THEY DO IN THE CITY THE WAY YOU SEE 
03:42:53 THE NUMBERS AND FIGURE HOW TO MAKE THEM WORK TO MAKE SURE WE 
03:42:59 CAN TAKE CARE OF OUR BUDGET AND TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS WITH 
03:43:03 SUMMER JOBS. HOW WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THE BUDGET AND AT THE 
03:43:08 SAME TIME TAKE CARE OF YOUNG MAN FOR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS 
03:43:13 LIKE BAM, HOW TO TAKE CARE THE BUDGET AND AT THE SAME TIME 
03:43:17 MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAVE A OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO COLLEGE IF 
03:43:21 THEY WANT TO. HOW YOU PUSH EXPECTATION WITH PARENTS IN ORDER 
03:43:26 TO GET THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS TO GET A BETTER GRADE IN SCHOOL. 
03:43:30 LET THEM KNOW IT IS UNACCEPTABLE. NOT AFRAID TO DO WHAT YOU 
03:43:34 THINK IS RIGHT. IT IS A VERY HONORABLE. I JUST WANT TO SAY 
03:43:40 THAT I KNOW THAT THIS CITY IS IN A BETTER PLACE THEN IT WAS 
03:43:45 BEFORE YOU GOT HERE. I RECOGNIZE ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU DO 
03:43:49 BECAUSE SOME OF THEM I DO THEM WITH YOU IN MY WARD AND I GO ON 
03:43:54 AND ON ABOUT A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN OUR WARD 
03:44:00 AND CITY OF CHICAGO, BUT YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT TO SAY TO AMY 
03:44:05 AND THE FAMILY, THANK YOU ALL FOR EMBRACING MY FAMILY. THANK 
03:44:13 YOU FOR SHARING HIM WITH US. WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. YOU 
03:44:17 HAVE HELPED ME TO GROW AS A ELECTED OFFICIAL AND PUBLIC 
03:44:21 SERVANT. I WANT TO SAY THAT THE CITY HAS BEEN BLESSED TO HAVE 
03:44:30 YOU AS OUR MAYOR. 
03:44:35 (APPLAUSE) 
03:44:36 >> I'LL ASK SINCE WE HAVE A LONG LIST AND DON'T SHORTEN THE 
03:44:44 WAY WE SPEAK WE ARE GOING TO BE HERE FOR DINNER SO SKIPPING 
03:44:47 LUNCH, SO WE'LL GO TO ALDERMAN DAVID MOORE AND KEEP ROLLING 
03:44:53 THROUGH IT. 
03:44:54 >> ALRIGHT. MR. PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'LL START 
03:44:58 OFF WITH RECOGNIZING MRS. AMY WHO I LIKE TO-WHETHER IN PUBLIC 
03:45:08 OR PRIVATE JOKINGLY SAY AMY RULES. I COME BACK TO THAT IN A 
03:45:15 MINUTE. AS PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT AND I'LL TRY TO BE AS SWIFT AS 
03:45:21 POSSIBLE, WHEN YOU WHETHER YOU ARE CALLED TO SERVE OR YOU JUST 
03:45:27 FELT THAT YOU NEEDED TO SERVE AND YOU WENT, BEING A PUBLIC 
03:45:33 SERVANT WHEN YOU ARE IN THE POSITION AND HAVE TO PEOPLE IT 
03:45:39 ISN'T ABOUT YOU AND IT IS ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE AND WHATEVER 
03:45:43 PEOPLE THINK ABOUT BEING IN THE POSITION WHETHER MY COLLEAGUES 
03:45:46 AND YOU MR. MAYOR I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR SERVING BECAUSE IT 
03:45:50 IS A TASK. YOU GIVE UP A LOT OF YOURSELF, YOU GIVE UP A LOT 
03:45:54 OF YOUR FAMILY AND FOR THAT I JUST SAY THANK YOU. HAD THE 
03:45:58 OPPORTUNITY FIRST MEETING WHETHER YOU REMEMBER OR NOT WHEN I 
03:46:01 WAS AT CHA UNDER LEADERSHIP OF TERRY PETERSON AND YOU WAS VICE 
03:46:09 CHAIR AND DURING THE BOARD MEETINGS THAT WAS THE TIMES I GOT 
03:46:12 TO STAND AND TALK TO YOU AND YOU DIDN'T REALIZE AT THE TIME 
03:46:16 YOU POURED THINGS INTO ME AS A DEVELOPMENT MANAGER HOW WE 
03:46:19 SUPPOSED TO PAY ATTENTION TO MAKING SURE THE RESIDENTS AND CHA 
03:46:25 WERE CARED FOR AND TRANSFORMATION WAS DONE PROPERLY. FROM 
03:46:30 THAT I LEARNED TO RESPECT YOU AND WHEN YOU RAN FOR CONGRESS 
03:46:36 GREG [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] REACHED OUT TO ME AND SAID DAVID 
03:46:39 WOULD YOU HELP HERE ON THE-I CAME OVER THERE BECAUSE I 
03:46:43 BELIEVED IN YOU AND SO FROM THAT WE HELP AND IT WAS GREAT WHEN 
03:46:47 YOU GOT ELECTED AND I ALWAYS SAID THAT YOU WERE A GREAT 
03:46:53 CONGRESSMAN. THEN I BECAME ALDERMAN, THINGS-RAN FOR ALDERMAN 
03:47:00 AND ONE THING I TOLD MY CONSTITUENCY, I SAID IF YOU SEE 
03:47:06 CHALLENGING THE MAYOR, BECAUSE EVERYBODY WOULD SAY YOU GOT TO 
03:47:09 BE AGAINST THE MAYOR. IT ISN'T ABOUT BEING AGAINST THE MAYOR, 
03:47:14 IF YOU SEE ME CHALLENGING HIM THAT IS BECAUSE I FEEL SOMETHING 
03:47:17 IS BEING TAKEN AWAY FOR THE LEAST OF THEM AND IF YOU SEE ME 
03:47:22 STANDING THEM THAT MEANS HE IS BRINGING SOMETHING TO THE 
03:47:26 COMMUNITY AND THERE ARE MANY OCCASIONS AND WAS ABLE TO STAND 
03:47:31 WITH YOU. WHAT STANDS OUT FOR ME WHEN I COME UP ON THE SOUTH 
03:47:37 SIDE OF CHICAGO HAVING MY FIRST SUMMER JOB I CANNOT REMEMBER 
03:47:41 FOR A LONG WHILE UNTIL YOU GOT IN THAT THE NUMBER OF SUMMER 
03:47:45 JOBS THAT HAS BEEN INCREASED FOR OUR YOUTH AND THAT IS JUST 
03:47:50 SPECTACULAR AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP NOT ONLY 
03:47:54 WITHIN THE CITY OF CHICAGO BUT REACHING OUT TO PRIVATE PEOPLE 
03:47:58 AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY HIRE OUR YOUTH. THE OTHER IS THE 
03:48:02 NEIGHBORHOOD OPPORTUNITY FUND WHICH HELPED ALL OF CHICAGO AND 
03:48:06 HELPING US BRING SMALL BUSINESSES TO OUR COMMUNITY. THINGS WE 
03:48:10 CAN POINT TO AND HELP GROW OUR COMMUNITY. I THINK ALDERMAN 
03:48:15 BURNETT MENTIONED THE EX OFFENDER PROGRAM MAKING SURE PEOPLE 
03:48:20 WHO HAVE COME BACK WITH THE RECORDS ARE RETURNING CITIZENS 
03:48:22 HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AND FOR THAT I SAY THANK YOU. AND THEN, I 
03:48:27 COME BACK TO THIS AMY RULES BECAUSE THERE IS TIMES YOU GOT TO 
03:48:33 HAVE A CHECK AND THIS WOMAN'S SPIRIT IS SO GREAT. I HAVE SEEN 
03:48:38 HER JUST ON MANY OCCASIONS OUTSIDE OF WHAT WE CALL THE 
03:48:43 POLITICAL SPHERE AND JUST BEING HER GENUINE SELF AND HER HEART 
03:48:47 IS REAL. TIMES WHEN I GET UPSET AND THINKS LIKE THAT I LOOK 
03:48:50 AT THIS AND SAY THIS MAN COULDN'T BE THIS BAD BECAUSE THIS 
03:48:54 WOMAN MARRIED HIM. I'M BEING HONEST. AND SO I WILL TO STEP 
03:49:02 BACK AND REFLECT. THERE WAS ONE THING I TOLD YOU, I SAID-WHEN 
03:49:08 I MET BEFORE YOU DON'T REMEMBER I SAID BECAUSE YOU-I GAVE AN 
03:49:12 ANALOGY, BECAUSE YOU PLAY FOOTBALL DOESN'T MEAN YOU PLAY EVERY 
03:49:20 POSITION. YOU HAVE DONE GOOD THINGS BUT ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU 
03:49:25 MAN, PRESIDENT, STUFF LIKE THAT IS ME AND I'LL BE THE FIRST TO 
03:49:29 STAND IN LINE BECAUSE IN MY OPINION THIS IS DAVID AND PROBABLY 
03:49:35 WENDY WILLIAMS TOO BECAUSE I HEARD HER SAY IT, IF ANYBODY CAN 
03:49:40 BEAT TRUMP AND THINK IT TAKES A RAHM EMANUEL TO DO IT. 
03:49:44 (APPLAUSE) 
03:49:45 AND SO I WAS SAYING BECAUSE YOU PLAY FOOTBALL MAYBE YOU WASN'T 
03:49:51 BY [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] BUT YOU ARE A TOM BRADY AND SO YOU 
03:49:55 THINK ABOUT THAT. THAT'S A CONVERSATION YOU AND YOUR WIFE TO 
03:50:00 HAVE BUT I'LL BE THE FIRST TO STAND UP BECAUSE- 
03:50:05 >> YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING, AMY RULES. 
03:50:08 >> AMY RULES. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE CITY AND I 
03:50:12 THANK YOU YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR CHILDREN AND THEIR ABSENCE 
03:50:16 DON'T BELIEVE THEY ARE HERE, PEOPLE DONT REALIZE THAT THE 
03:50:19 SACRIFICE THE CHILDREN MAKE WHEN YOUR PARENTS SERVE AND THE 
03:50:24 PRESSURE ON THEM SO SEND THEM MY LOVE AND THANKS. THANK YOU 
03:50:31 SO MUCH. 
03:50:32 >> ALDERMAN BURKE. 
03:50:33 >> THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. I'LL BE BRIEF. I SAT ABOUT THE 
03:50:41 RESOLUTIONS IN THE PAST IT NICEST THING ABOUT THEM THEY DON'T 
03:50:45 BEGIN BY SAYING WHEREBY ALL MIGHTY GOD [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] 
03:50:53 THERE IS A GREAT DEAL TO BE SAID FOR LEAVING THIS CHAMBER AT 
03:50:57 YOUR OWN VOLITION. YOU'VE QUOTED RABBI [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] 
03:51:04 IN REMARKS IN THIS CHAMBER ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. I WOULD 
03:51:11 ASSERT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THAT THE WISDOM OF THOSE WORDS 
03:51:18 THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN IS REFLECTED IN YOUR OWN PRESENCE, 
03:51:28 PERSONALITY AND CAREER. IF I'M NOT FOR MYSELF, WHO WILL BE 
03:51:33 FOR ME? IF I'M NOT FOR OTHERS, WHAT AM I? AND IF NOT NOW, 
03:51:40 WHEN? THOSE ARE WISE AND TRUE WORDS THAT YOU HAVE REFLECTED 
03:51:49 IN YOUR LIFE AND CAREER. THE WORD EMANUEL APPEARS IN THE BOOK 
03:51:59 OF ISAIAH AND IT MEANS, GOD IS WITH US. AS A SIGN THAT GOD 
03:52:07 WOULD PROTECT THE HOUSE OF DAVID, YOU THIS EMANUEL HAS 
03:52:16 PROTECTED FOR 8 YEARS THE HOUSE OF CHICAGO, AND LET ME SAY 
03:52:24 JUST ONE THING ABOUT AMY. MUCH HAS BEEN SAID THIS AFTERNOON 
03:52:30 ABOUT HER AND RIGHTLY SO, BUT WE ALL KNOW ONE THING, YOUR 
03:52:37 HONOR, YOU MARRIED UP. GOOD LUCK. GOOD HEALTH TO ALL THE 
03:52:42 FAMILY. 
03:52:43 >> THANK YOU. 
03:52:44 (APPLAUSE) 
03:52:45 >> ALDERMAN SILVERSTEIN. 
03:52:50 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS 
03:52:54 RESOLUTION. OUR FRIENDSHIP GOES BACK 8 YEARS AGO WHEN YOU 
03:52:58 CAME OUT TO THE 50 WARD AND KNOCKED ON DOORS WITH ME AND THAT 
03:53:06 I WILL NOT FORGET. IT WAS A GREAT WAY TO START OUR FRIENDSHIP 
03:53:10 AND ONCE YOU TOOK OFFICE YOU DID MOVE CHICAGO FORWARD AND THE 
03:53:15 50 FORWARD AND FOR THAT I THANK YOU WITH ALL MY HEART. I WILL 
03:53:21 PICK UP ON A COUPLE WORDS ALDERMAN LORENO WAS TALKING ABOUT. 
03:53:27 THROUGH THE YEARS I HAVE DONE A LOT OF [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] 
03:53:29 BUT AT THE SAME TIME I HAVE DONE A LOT COVING AND COVERED FOR 
03:53:38 ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS YOU HAVE DONE AND WANT TO WISH YOU 
03:53:42 AND AMY THE VERY BEST OF LUCK AND WANT YOU TO KNOW I AND THOSE 
03:53:47 IN THE CHAMBER WILL MISS YOU DEARLY AND WISH YOU ONLY THE 
03:53:51 BEST. THANK YOU. 
03:53:52 >> ALDERMAN JOE MOORE. 
03:53:54 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. AS ONE OF THOSE IN THIS CHAMBER 
03:54:00 WHO ISN'T LEAVING ON HIS OWN VOLITION, I JUST WANT TO SAY 
03:54:06 THIS, YOU KNOW, I HOPE NEWS MEDIA AND THOSE HERE IN THE 
03:54:16 GALLERY HERE LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF THESE ELECTED OFFICIALS. 
03:54:21 THE ELECTED OFFICIALS CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE. THIS IS NOT-WHAT 
03:54:26 WE ARE HEARING TODAY ISN'T THE USUAL POLITICAL BROMIDES. 
03:54:32 PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING FROM THE HEART. I THINK ONE THING WE ARE 
03:54:36 GOING TO RECOGNIZE AS TIME GOES ON IS JUST HOW LUCKY WE HAVE 
03:54:43 BEEN IN THE CITY FOR THE LAST 8 YEARS WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP, 
03:54:46 AND I THINK OVER TIME HISTORY WILL TREAT YOUR TENURE VERY VERY 
03:54:55 KINDLY. YOU CAME IN AT A VERY DIFFICULT TIME IN OUR CITY'S 
03:55:01 HISTORY, AND YOU SPENT A HECK OF A LOT OF POLITICAL CAPITAL TO 
03:55:10 STEER OUR SHIP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WE ARE NOT OUT OF THE 
03:55:14 WOODS YET, AND THE NEXT MAYOR AND NEXT COUNCIL HAVE TO MAKE 
03:55:19 ADDITIONAL VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS AND HOPEFULLY THEY WON'T 
03:55:23 HESITATE TO SPEND MORE POLITICAL CAPITAL BECAUSE WE OWE IT NOT 
03:55:28 ONLY TO THE PEOPLE ALIVE TODAY, BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE YET TO 
03:55:33 BE BORN. IT IS A GREAT CITY, AND IT DESERVES THE KIND OF COR 
03:55:42 AGES LEADERSHIP YOU EXHIBITED. A LOT OF PEOPLE MADE NOTE OF 
03:55:45 THE FACT THAT I WAS OFTEN AT ODDS WITH THE PREVIOUS MAYOR, AND 
03:55:52 I MEAN NO DISRESPECT AT ALL TO MAYOR DALEY. I ADMIRE HIS LOVE 
03:55:59 FOR THE CITY BUT WE HAD OUR DISAGREEMENTS. PEOPLE WOULD ASK 
03:56:03 ME AFTER FEW YEARS THAT I SERVED WITH MAYOR EMANUEL, JOE MOORE 
03:56:10 YOU CHANGED. YOU ARE NO LONG ER THE INDEPENDENT. YOU ARE IN 
03:56:15 BED WITH THE MAYOR. WHY HAVE YOU CHANGED? MY RESPONSE IS 
03:56:20 ALWAYS THIS, I HAVE NEVER CHANGED. I HAVEN'T CHANGED. THE 
03:56:25 PERSON WHO SITS IN THE 5TH FLOOR OF CITY HALL CHANGED. A 
03:56:31 DIFFERENT MAYOR. A MORE PROGRESSIVE MAYOR. ONE THING HE DID 
03:56:36 LIKE WITH ALL YOU WHEN HE BECAME MAYOR ELECT IS HE CALLED ME 
03:56:40 UP AND INVITED ME INTO HIS OFFICE TO MEET AND ASKED WHAT DID I 
03:56:46 NEED, WHAT WERE MY CONCERNS AND I MENTIONED RIGHT OFF THE BAT 
03:56:50 THE CLEAN POWER ORDINANCE THAT MANY WHO HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A 
03:56:55 WHILE RECALL I WAS THE CHIEF SPONSOR OF TO TARGET COAL FIRE 
03:57:01 POWER PLANTS HARMING THE HEALTH OF OUR RESIDENTS AND HARMING 
03:57:04 OUR ENVIRONMENT. THE ORDINANCE EITHER COMPELLED THEM TO CLEAN 
03:57:10 UP OR SHUT DOWN. THE MAYOR GAVE HIS ASSURANCE THAT WOULD BE 
03:57:15 HIS TOP PRIORITY AS WELL AND WITHIN A FEW MONTHS BOTH THE 
03:57:19 POWER PLANTS SHUT DOWN. YOU ALSO KNOW IF YOU HAVE BEEN AROUND 
03:57:23 A WHILE I WAS A ADVOCATE FOR LIVING WAGES AND IT WAS THROUGH 
03:57:30 THE EFFORTS OF ME AND OTHERS IN THIS COUNCIL AND FRIENDS IN 
03:57:35 LABOR AND ADVOCATES THAT WE FORCED MAYOR DALEY TO EXERCISE THE 
03:57:45 VETO PEN AND ABLE TO PREVENT A LIVING WAGE ORDINANCE BEING 
03:57:50 ENACTED. ONE OF THE MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT RESOLUTION 
03:57:55 HONORING MAYOR FAILED TO MENTION IS CITY OF CHICAGO NOW HAS A 
03:58:00 MINIMUM WAGE ORDINANCE. NOW HAS A ORDINANCE PROVIDING PAID 
03:58:06 SICK LEAVE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT POLITICAL REFORMERS WERE 
03:58:12 ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT WAS THE EVER PRESENT POLITICAL 
03:58:20 PATRONAGE PEOPLE WERE HIRED NOT BECAUSE OF ABILITY BUT WHO 
03:58:25 THEY KNEW. AND IT WAS UNDER THIS MAYOR'S ADMINISTRATION THAT 
03:58:31 THE SHACKMAN DECREE WAS FINALLY LIFTED AND THE COURT FELT 
03:58:37 COMFORTABLE ENOUGH THEY NO LONGER HAD TO MONITOR THE HIRING 
03:58:41 DONE WITH THE CITY BECAUSE THEY FELT THIS WAS ALL DONE ON THE 
03:58:45 UP AND UP. UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL, ALDERMAN BURNETT MENTIONED 
03:58:50 VERY EMOTIONALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BROUGHT HUNDREDS OF UNIT 
03:58:57 OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO MY COMMUNITY. SO, THIS IS THE LAST 8 
03:59:05 YEARS QUITE FRANKLY I HAD 28 GREAT YEARS, BUT THE LAST 8 YEARS 
03:59:10 HAVE BEEN THE MOST FULFILLING BECAUSE I REALLY FELT THAT WE 
03:59:14 HAD SOMEONE THAT CHAIR OVER THERE WHO LISTENED, WHO RESPONDED, 
03:59:21 AND MOVED THE CITY NOT ONLY IN A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE 
03:59:24 DIRECTION, BUT ALSO A VERY PROGRESSIVE POSITION. THANK YOU, 
03:59:30 MAYOR AND ALLOW ME TO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO PAY KUDOS 
03:59:36 TO FIRST LADY. YOU AND I DO HAVE SOMETHING VERY MUCH IN 
03:59:42 COMMON, THAT WE BOTH MARRIED UP. ON BEHALF OF THE FIRST LADY 
03:59:46 OF THE 49TH WARD I EXTEND TO YOU AND THE FIRST LADY OF CHICAGO 
03:59:51 OUR BEST HOPES FOR THE FUTURE. 
03:59:53 >> THANK YOU. 
03:59:54 (APPLAUSE) 
03:59:55 >> ALDERMAN OSTERMAN. 
03:59:57 >> I WANT TO WISH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AMY ALL THE BEST. AND 
04:00:03 THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO CHICAGO AND EVERY WARD OF THE 
04:00:07 CITY YOU HAD A IMPACT AND MADE A DIFFERENCE. I REALLY WANT TO 
04:00:10 THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK WITH YOUTH. OUR CITY IS FACED 
04:00:15 VIOLENCE EVERY CORNER OF THE CITY, AND YOUR EFFORTS WITH 
04:00:19 MENTORING, WITH BAM, WITH WOW, WITH SUMMER JOBS KIDS ARE 
04:00:25 GETTING MENTORING AFTER SCHOOL AND HAVE A JOB THIS SUMMER 
04:00:30 BECAUSE OF YOUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND THAT, THAT IS A LASTING 
04:00:35 IMPACT ON THEIR LIFE AND ALSO THE LIFE OOF CHICAGO AND THAT IS 
04:00:39 SOMETHING THAT IS A LASTING LEGACY FOR YOU. I WANT TO THANK 
04:00:45 YOU SUPPORTING NEIGHBORHOOD HIGH SCHOOLS. LAKE VIEW, 
04:00:51 [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] HIGH SCHOOLS AROUND THE CITY, THERE ARE 8 
04:00:53 GRADERS CHOOSING THE SCHOOLS WHERE 8 YEARS AGO THEY WOULDN'T 
04:00:57 CONSIDER IT AND THAT WAS A COMMITMENT WITH YOU AND YOUR 
04:01:00 EXPANSION ON STEM AND IT THAT HAS A LASTING IMPACT. PUBLIC 
04:01:06 TRANSPORTATION WHICH ISN'T A SEXY THING, WE HAVE CITIES IN OUR 
04:01:10 COUNTRY THAT ARE CRUMBLING WITH PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WHICH 
04:01:16 EFFECTS EVERYTHING GOING ON BUT YOUR COMMITMENT ON THE NORTH 
04:01:21 AND SOUTH SIDE CONNECTING TO THE ARE ED LOO IN WILL HAVE A 
04:01:27 LASTING IMPACT. THERE ARE MANY THINGS YOU HAVE DONE AND LEFT 
04:01:31 THE CITY IN A BETTER POSITION FINANCIALLY YOU HAVE HIRED GREAT 
04:01:34 PEOPLE WHICH I THINK SOMETIMES DOZENT GET A LOT OF FANFARE. 
04:01:38 YOU PUT THEM IN PLACE AND HAVE THEM DO THE WORK YOU NEEDED 
04:01:42 DONE AND THEY GOT THE WORK DONE. AGAIN, ON BEHALF OF THE 
04:01:45 PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY, I WANT TO THANK YOU AND WISH YOU ALL 
04:01:48 THE BEST. 
04:01:52 >> ALDERMAN MORENO. 
04:01:54 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. I-DON'T LOOK SURPRISE. I DO 
04:02:00 RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. 
04:02:02 >> I WILL SIT FOR THIS ONE. 
04:02:07 >> I'LL BE BRIEF. FOR SURE. WHEN WE FIRST MET WASN'T IN 
04:02:14 POLITICS. WHEN YOU WERE CONGRESSMAN WE FIRST SAT DOWN AND 
04:02:18 TALKED WHEN YOU WERE MAYOR ELECT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE LAST 
04:02:25 EARMARK FOR THE STREETSCAPE PROJECT [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] FOR 
04:02:29 ME AS A [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] THE REASON WHY I GOT INTO THIS 
04:02:32 THING IN THE FIRST PLACE. I WANTED TO SEE ECONOMIC 
04:02:35 DEVELOPMENT, INVESTMENT IN THE AREA AND WHAT WAS PROPOSED ME 
04:02:39 AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS PRESSURED THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION 
04:02:45 AND MY PREDECESSOR PAT LAVAR TO PUSH FOR MORE AND BETTER AND 
04:02:49 BRING A REAL STREETSCAPE PROJECT, WHICH DID HAPPEN AND THAT 
04:02:52 WAS SOMETHING YOU DID IN CONGRESS. DURING THAT MEETING YOU 
04:02:59 DID SOMETHING ELSE, YOU SAID IF I HAD A PRINCIPLE TO VOTE I 
04:03:04 SHOULD GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT, AND SO I-YOU MADE ME THE ALDERMAN 
04:03:08 I AM TODAY BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO DO THAT ANYWAY, BUT I WAS 
04:03:13 LIKE OKAY, HE IS SAYING GO AHEAD AND DO THAT. AND THEN THERE 
04:03:19 WAS THE TERMINAL 5 DEBATE AND FROM THAT THERE IT MAY HAVE SET 
04:03:24 STANDARDS BETWEEN US. ONE THING IN A HONEST MOMENT THERE IS A 
04:03:29 LOT WE SHARE PERSONALTY WISE. WE BOTH BELIEVE EWE ARE RIGHT 
04:03:33 AND NOBODY WILL TELL US OTHERWISE. WE BOTH RESEARCH AND COME 
04:03:36 TO A PLACE WHERE WE THINK WE ARE DOING THE BEST WE CAN AND 
04:03:39 THAT'S OKAY. AS YOU SAID WE CAN DISAGREE BUT IT IS FOR THE 
04:03:43 DEMOCRATIC PROCESS FOR THE DEBATE AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT. I 
04:03:47 HAVE LEARNED THINGS FROM YOU, I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU ON 
04:03:52 OCCASIONS, AND I VOTED AGAINST PROBABLY MORE BUDGETS THEN I 
04:03:58 VOTED FOR, BUT IN 2016 I THINK IT WAS THE BUDGET WHERE WE DID 
04:04:02 THE PROPERTY TAX YEARS TO ADDRESS THE PENSION AND THAT WAS THE 
04:04:06 THING THAT I ALSO RAN WHEN I TALKED TO MY CONSTITUENTS THAT WE 
04:04:11 NEEDED TO ADDRESS, THAT WE NEEDED TO FIND A WAY TO DO THAT AND 
04:04:15 A BIG PART OF MY OPPOSITION TO EARLIER BUDGETS IS WE WERE NOT 
04:04:21 TAKING A BITE OUT OF THE APPLE AND THAT BUDGET YOU DID. YOU 
04:04:24 TOOK A VERY KEY LEADERSHIP ROLE MAKING SURE WE FOUND MONEY TO 
04:04:30 ADDRESS THE POLICE AND FIRE BUDGETS AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE 
04:04:34 MUNICIPAL AND LABOR BUDGET AND THAT WAS SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO 
04:04:38 ME NOT HAVING EVERY BEEN A CITY WORKER BUT KNOWING IT WAS 
04:04:45 IMPORTANT FOR THE CITY FINANCIAL HEALTH AND I'M SURE YOU GAVE 
04:04:48 HAND WRITTEN NOTES TO OTHER PEOPLE THANKING BUT YOU DID GIVE 
04:04:51 ME A HAND WRITTEN NOTE THANKING ME FOR THE VOTE AND STILL HAVE 
04:04:55 THE LETTER AND IT DOES MEAN A LOT TO ME. SCOTT WAGUESPACK I 
04:05:03 THINK I HAVE A WORKING THEORY THAT THE ELON MUSK TUNNEL WAS 
04:05:11 DESIGNED TO ALLOW HIM TO GET TO THE AIRPORT WITHOUT COMING TO 
04:05:16 OUR WARDS. THAT IS JUST A WORKING THEORY, CAN'T PROVE IT. I 
04:05:19 DO KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE WARD AND COUPLE YEARS AGO YOU 
04:05:23 CALLED ME RIGHT BEFORE A BUDGET VOTE AND I THOUGHT HERE IT IS, 
04:05:26 HERE'S THE CALL WHERE HE'LL ASK FOR MY VOTE ON THE BUDGET BUT 
04:05:31 YOU DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT. YOU TALKED ABOUT FANNIE'S COFFEE 
04:05:37 AND HOW MUCH YOU AND AMY LIKE THE COFFEE. YOU TOLD ME HOW 
04:05:42 MUCH YOU ENJOYED THE COFFEE AND THEN I THOUGHT OKAY THAT WAS 
04:05:45 THE NICETY AND NOW I'LL GET THE ASK AND THEN HE WAS OKAY, HAVE 
04:05:49 A NICE DAY. I GUESS YOU KNOW WHERE I WAS ON THAT ALREADY BUT 
04:05:54 I APPRECIATE- 
04:05:55 >> I ASSUMED IT. 
04:05:56 >> BUT I KNOW THAT YOU WERE PAYING ATTENTION TO SOME THINGS IN 
04:06:04 THE 45 WARD AND THERE IS A LOT WE HAVE GOTTEN DONE. SCHOOL 
04:06:07 IMPROVEMENTS, EXPANSION FOR EARLY EDUCATION, HIGH SCHOOL 
04:06:12 [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] PRESSING ELEMENTARY BIG PROJECT AND EVERY 
04:06:15 SCHOOL IN THE WARD HAS BENEFITED FROM THE MONEY WE HAVE BEEN 
04:06:19 ABLE TO ALLOCATE THERE. AND AMY, I SAID THERE IS A LOT THAT 
04:06:24 WE PROBABLY SHARE IN TERMS OF PERSONALTY AND I KNOW YOU HAVE 
04:06:29 TO BE AN AMAZING PERSON BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT I PUT MY WIFE JILL 
04:06:35 THROUGH EVERY DAY AND SHE STAYED WITH ME 27 YEARS SO GOD BLESS 
04:06:38 YOU FOR PUTTING UP WITH HIM AND OFFERING TO THE CITY AND THE 
04:06:42 LEADERSHIP HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE. WHETHER WE DISAGREED 
04:06:49 OR NOT THE CITY IS BETTER FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP SO THANK YOU. 
04:06:52 (APPLAUSE) 
04:06:53 >> ALDERMAN NAPOLITANO.

04:09:20 >> ALDERMAN ROSA. 
04:09:22 >> MR. PRESIDENT I RISE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RESOLUTION. 
04:09:28 IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NICE TO SAY DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT 
04:09:31 ALL BUT HAVE NICE THINGS TO SAY SO I'LL SAY THEM. I WANT TO 
04:09:34 THANK YOU FOR DOING WORK TO IMPROVE THE PROTECTION OF 
04:09:37 IMMIGRANTS HERE IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO. FOR FIRST TIME EVER 
04:09:40 CHICAGO HAS A IMMIGRANT LEGAL DEFENSE FUND TO INSURE THE 
04:09:45 UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS HAVE RESOURCES TO STAY WITH FAMILIES 
04:09:50 AND NEIGHBORHOODS THEY CALL HOME. FOR THE FIST TIME WE HAVE 
04:09:53 MUNICIPAL ID. SOMETHING TALKED ABOUT MANY MANY YEARS AND THIS 
04:09:57 MAYOR AND ADMINISTRATION MADE IT HAPPEN. WE HAVE A ORDINANCE 
04:10:02 THAT INSURE POLICE CANNOT ABUSE OR COERCE BASED ON IMMIGRATION 
04:10:07 OR NATIONALITY STATUS. A CHANGE I WAS HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU 
04:10:12 TO BRING ABOUT BECAUSE OF A INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED SO THANK 
04:10:16 YOU FOR DOING THE WORK TO MAKE SURE IN THE CITY WE ARE 
04:10:19 PROTECTING INTEGRATING IMMIGRANTS LIKE WE HAVEN'T IN THE PAST. 
04:10:24 THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO HAPPEN AFTER YOU ARE 
04:10:27 NO LONGER WITH US BUT THAT ARE CRITICAL THAT YOU WERE CRITICAL 
04:10:30 TO MAKE HAPPEN. ONE OF THOSE IS THE HUNDRED UNITS OF 
04:10:34 AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE ARE WORKING TO BRING TO THE LOGAN 
04:10:40 SQUARE. THANK YOU FOR WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES FOR MANY 
04:10:44 MONTHS AND YEAR AND HOPE YOU WILL JOIN US WHEN WE CUT THE 
04:10:47 RIBBON IN LOGAN SQUARE BECAUSE IT WAS YOU AND YOUR 
04:10:51 ADMINISTRATION THAT WILL MAKE THAT POSSIBLE AND THANK YOU FOR 
04:10:55 THE GREEN SPACE IN LOGAN SQUARE. THAT IS SOMETHING CDOT 
04:11:01 WORKED MANY MONTHS ON. WHILE IT WON'T COME ABOUT UNTIL AFTER 
04:11:05 YOU DEPARTED YOU MADE THAT POSSIBLE. THE ORDINANCE THAT 
04:11:10 BRINGS 20 PERCENT AFFORDABILITY TO THE PILOT AREA ALONG 
04:11:14 [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] I HOPE WE CAN USE THAT MANY MORE YEARS TO 
04:11:16 COME. AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. I DON'T HAVE TO SAY 
04:11:20 MUCH MORE. THANK YOU AMY FOR ALLOWING YOUR HUSBAND TO SERVE 
04:11:24 THE CITY OF CHICAGO. PUBLIC SERVICE IS HARD. YOU TOOK ON A 
04:11:28 BIG TOUGH JOB AND YOU DID IT VERY WELL, SO CONGRATULATIONS AND 
04:11:34 THE BEST OF LUCK TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. 
04:11:36 >> ALDERMAN MELL. 
04:11:38 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. I JUST RECORDED THAT FOR 
04:11:45 POSTERITY.

04:11:48 SO, UNBELIEVABLE. SO, I WANT TO THANK YOU AMY RECOGNIZE THE 
04:12:05 FIRST LADY OF CHICAGO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP 
04:12:08 FOR COMING OUT TO THE WARD AND RIBBON CUTTINGS. WE LOVED

04:12:20 INCREDIBLE. THEY ARE LINED UP THERE, MARIA AND THANK YOU FOR 
04:12:23 EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE. I REMEMBER IT WAS OVER 8 YEARS AGO 
04:12:27 WHERE WE WENT OUT TO DINNER AND YOU WERE JUST MAYOR ELECT AND 
04:12:31 I WAS A STATE REPRESENTATIVE AND WE WERE SITTING HAVING DINNER 
04:12:35 AND SOMEONE CAME UP FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGE, I FORGOT WHAT HER 
04:12:40 POSITION WAS AND SHE WANTED TO CONGRATULATE YOU AND WENT INTO 
04:12:46 WE NEED TO GET OUR KIDS HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO COMMUNITY 
04:12:49 COLLEGES. THIS WAS OVER 8 YEARS AGO AND YOU DID THAT, AND YOU 
04:12:53 DIDN'T HAVE-THERE WAS NO SMALL TALK. THERE WAS RIGHT OFF THE 
04:12:56 BACK YOU ARE GETTING READY TO GET TO WORK FOR THE KIDS OF THE 
04:13:00 CITY OF CHICAGO. EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT PROJECTS. THE 312 
04:13:06 RIVER RUN IS GOING TO BE AMAZING IN OUR WARD. THE WAY YOU 
04:13:09 ACTIVATED THE RIVER, OUR HALF MILE OF RIVER FRONT-THEY TALK 
04:13:16 ABOUT ALL THE INVESTMENT IN DOWNTOWN, WE HAD THE RIVER FRONT 
04:13:20 INVESTMENT AND HAD A $6 MILLION PROJECT IN HORNER PARK AND IT 
04:13:23 IS A BEAUTIFUL. IT TOTALLY OPENED THE RIVER AND BEAUTIFUL. I 
04:13:28 ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT ALSO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE WILL 
04:13:35 PRESERVE 250 UNIT IN ALBANY PARK. THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
04:13:47 >> ALDERMAN SANTIAGO. 
04:13:49 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. OBVIOUSLY THE ONES-THE OUTCOMES 
04:13:54 ARE LAST TO SPEAK RIGHT MR. COUNCIL? JUST JOKING. MR. MAYOR, 
04:14:03 I ALSO WANT TO RISE TO RECOGNIZE THIS RESOLUTION IN YOUR HONOR 
04:14:08 AND THE RESOLUTION THAT HIGHLIGHTS YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND 
04:14:12 THE LEGACY THAT YOU LEAVE BEHIND. I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT. 
04:14:15 BUT THIS IS A SPECIAL DAY ONLY FOR YOU AS YOU PREPARE TO MAYBE 
04:14:21 TAKE A GOOD VACATION AFTER MAY 20 WITH YOUR LOVELY WIFE AMY. 
04:14:30 IT IS BITTERSWEET. THIS IS MY LAST CITY COUNCIL AS WELL HERE. 
04:14:35 BUT, I HAVE TO THANK GOD FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY THAT HE GAVE ME 
04:14:40 TO BE PART OF THIS COUNCIL FOR 4 YEARS AND I HAVE ENJOYED 
04:14:46 EVERY DAY OF THE 4 YEARS IN OFFICE. MR. PRESIDENT, FOR THE 
04:14:51 REST OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE I REALLY WANT TO THANK THE SUPPORT 
04:14:55 THAT HAVE BEEN GETTING HERE THROUGHOUT THE YEARS. THE 
04:14:59 LEARNING PROCESS AS WE EMBARK SAID IN THIS MISSION TO SERVE 
04:15:04 THE COMMUNITY THAT I REPRESENTED FOR 4 YEARS. AS I WILL NOT 
04:15:10 BE HERE NEXT MONTH, I SERVE ONE TERM HERE, BUT THIS IS NOT THE 
04:15:17 END OF THE ROAD FOR ME. THERE'S SOMETHING BETTER WAITING FOR 
04:15:22 ME AND I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT WILL HAPPEN. I AM PROUD OF THE 
04:15:26 JOB THAT I DID AS ALDERMAN OF THE 31 WARD AND PROUD THE 
04:15:32 ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE PROJECTS AND POSITIVE CHANGES WE WERE 
04:15:35 ABLE TO HAVE IN SUCH A SHORT TIME. THAT IS SOMETHING NOBODY 
04:15:41 WILL TAKE AWAY FROM ME. WE BROUGHT JOBS THROUGH NEW 
04:15:47 BUSINESSES THAT ALSO CREATED NEW REVENUE FOR THE CITY. 
04:15:54 VARIOUS HOUSING PROJECTS. CITY SERVICE ON A DALEY BASIS. 
04:16:00 INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE STILL ONGOING. WE BROUGHT 
04:16:08 SERVICES AND PROJECTS TO FORMAN HIGH SCHOOL TO THE LIBRARY ON 
04:16:13 BELMONT AND LARAMIE THROUGH TIFF MONEY. TIFF MONEY THAT IS 
04:16:20 ABSOLUTELY NEEDED TO ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS 
04:16:26 FOR OUR FAMILIES AND THE RESIDENTS IN GENERAL AND I'M PROUD OF 
04:16:31 THAT. SO, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE ALSO 
04:16:36 MENTION MORE POLICE PROTECTION THAT WE WERE ABLE TO BRING TO 
04:16:40 THE 31 WARD. THE BUDGET PROGRAMMING WE IMPLEMENTED THAT GAVE 
04:16:46 A SPECIFIC VERY SPECIAL TOOL FOR RESIDENTS TO BE PART OF THE 
04:16:52 DECISION MAKING WHEN IT COMES TO SPENDING MANY MONEY. IT WAS 
04:16:58 A INCLUSIVE PROGRAM THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE EMBRACED VERY 
04:17:05 POSITIVELY. THE SENSE OF TRANSPARENCY, HONESTY AND TO BRING 
04:17:13 THE TRUST PEOPLE LOST IN GOVERNMENT AND I AM PROUD TO SAY I 
04:17:18 WAS LEADING BY EXAMPLE WHEN IT COMES TO BEING TRANSPARENT AND 
04:17:24 A HARD WORKING PERSON. I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOUR LOVELY WIFE 
04:17:30 AMY WHO CAME TO THE WARD SEVERAL TIMES AND SHE IS VERY HUMBLE, 
04:17:33 VERY APPROACHABLE AND SHE'S VERY INSPIRING WHEN WE HAD SOME 
04:17:38 MOMENTS SHARING WITH PARENTS, WITH STUDENTS, WITH TEACHERS. I 
04:17:44 WILL ALSO HAVE THIS SPECIAL PLACE. IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT 
04:17:51 BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR HEART IN THE COMMUNITY AND HAVE THE 
04:17:58 PASSION TO SERVE THE PEOPLE THAT BACKED YOU UP IN SO MANY 
04:18:02 DIFFERENT WAYS, IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND TO ACCEPT 
04:18:08 AT THE SAME TIME. BUT YOU KNOW, POLITICS IS-THIS IS PART OF 
04:18:12 OUR POLITICS IS ALL ABOUT. I TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY AS A VERY 
04:18:19 SPECIAL PART OF MY LIFE AS AN ADULTS AS A PROFESSIONALS AND AS 
04:18:25 A MOTHER BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN A VERY INSPIRATIONAL TERM FOR ME 
04:18:32 I WISH EVERYBODY NOTHING ABOUT THE VERY BEST IN YOUR NEW TERM 
04:18:37 THAT IT IS A FEW WEEKS AWAY. I LEARNED WITH EVERYONE OF YOU 
04:18:44 SO MANY THINGS AND I LIKE TO THANK ALL THOSE COLLEAGUES THAT 
04:18:49 SUPPORTED ME IN MANY WAYS, AND MR. PRESIDENT I ALSO WISH YOU 
04:18:55 THE VERY BEST. I LEARNED A LOT WITH YOU. YOU WERE VERY 
04:18:59 SUPPORTIVE IN DIFFERENT PROJECTS I HAD IN MY WARD. YOU ARE 
04:19:03 ALWAYS VERY ACCESSIBLE ALSO AND I APPRECIATE IT SO I JUST HOPE 
04:19:09 PROJECTS PENDING IN THE WARD LIKE THE HOUSING PROJECT FOR 
04:19:13 WORKING FAMILIES AND RETIRED SENIORS CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD 
04:19:16 BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE OF MY DREAMS. I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOUR 
04:19:20 STAFF. YOU HAVE AN AMAZING STAFF THAT WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR ME 
04:19:26 EVERY TIME I REACHED OUT TO ONE OF THEM OR I NEEDED SOME HELP 
04:19:31 OR GUIDANCE THEY WERE THERE FOR ME SO THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL 
04:19:34 OF YOU FOR THE GREAT JOB THAT YOU HAVE DONE AND FOR YOUR 
04:19:38 SUPPORT AS WELL. 
04:19:45 (APPLAUSE) 
04:19:46 >> SO, I ALSO WANT TO WISH OUR MAYOR ELECT LAURIE LIGHTFOOT 
04:19:57 THE VERY BEST AS SHE IS ABOUT TO START THIS INTERESTING AND 
04:20:02 DIFFICULT ROLE AS THE MAYOR OF CHICAGO. I SUPPORTED HER 
04:20:06 OPENLY AND WISH HER THE VERY BEST AND KNOW SHE IS VERY 
04:20:10 COMMITTED INTO GOALS OF CONTINUE MOVING THE CITY FORWARD AND 
04:20:17 SURE THE MAJORITY OF THE RESIDENT OF THE CITY ARE ALSO CRYING 
04:20:21 OUT LOUD FOR A NEW ADMINISTRATION THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BRING 
04:20:26 A LOT OF GOOD THINGS FOR EVERYONE IN THE CITY. THANK YOU SO 
04:20:32 MUCH EVERYBODY. 
04:20:35 >> THANK YOU. 
04:20:36 >> AND WISH YOU THE VERY BEST AND WE WILL BE AROUND. 
04:20:39 >> THANK YOU. [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] 
04:20:42 >> PRESIDENT. I DIDN'T SAY NOTHING. 
04:20:48 >> LET'S GO. 
04:20:49 >> MOST KNOW I'M A LAWYER, A FEW KNOW I'M A FUNERAL DIRECTOR 
04:20:59 AND CONTRARY WHAT CHAIRMAN BURKE WAS SAYING THIS LOOKS LIKE A 
04:21:03 EULOGY THEN A CELEBRATION SO I'LL TURN IT AROUND A BIT. I 
04:21:09 WILL TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED. I HAVE BEEN 
04:21:14 DISAPPOINTED IN THE THINGS YOU HAVE DONE BECAUSE I KNOW MANY 
04:21:17 YEARS OF US YEARS AGO SUPPORTED SOMEBODY ELSE FOR MAYOR BUT WE 
04:21:21 HEARD THE LEGEND OF RAHM. I'M TELLING YOU THAT I HAVE BEEN 
04:21:26 DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I HAD A BIG TUB OF GARRETT'S POPCORN 
04:21:32 READY FOR THE SHOW. I WANTED TO SEE THE DEAD [INAUDIBLE 
04:21:38 COMMENTS] I WANTED TO SEE THE F YOU RAHM AND WE HAVE SOLVE SAW 
04:21:45 NONE OF THAT FOR THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A DISAPPOINTMENT TO 
04:21:50 EVERYBODY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT.

04:22:02 [LAUGHTER] 
04:22:04 >> I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY AS SOMEONE WHO WHEN I GO AROUND I 
04:22:11 KNOW YOUR FATHER AND LOVE YOUR FATHER HE'S A GREAT PERSON AND

04:23:12 >> ROCK IT. 
04:23:13 >> BEFORE. YOU DEFINITELY BECAME A ANCHOR IN MY HEART AND IN 
04:23:20 MY LIFE. I REMEMBER ONE WEDNESDAY MORNING WHEN CITY COUNCIL

04:30:38 HAVE SEEN. I APPRECIATE THAT AND THE LOVE THAT YOU PUT INTO 
04:30:41 THE CITY. I ALSO-AMY WANT TO THANK YOU NOT ONLY JUST FOR YOUR 
04:30:51 FRIENDSHIP BUT FOR YOUR SACRIFICE OF YOU PERSONALLY AND YOUR 
04:31:00 FAMILY. YOUR ROLE AS FIRST LADY ENHANCED THE MAYOR'S ROLE AND 
04:31:05 HIS SERVICE. WHAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU I THINK IS THAT

04:31:15 AMERICAN FESTIVAL, I CAN SAY THIS IN THE 5TH WARD, BUT YOU

04:31:57 THE GAVEL DOWN. FIRST, WHEN I WAS ELECTED IN 2007 I HAD 
04:32:04 REALLY HIGH HOPES FOR THE THIRD WARD, AND UNFORTUNATELY THE 
04:32:09 RECESSION HIT AND A LOT OF THINGS [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] AND 
04:32:16 WHEN YOU WERE ELECTED I HAVE TO ADMIT I WAS NOT SURE WHAT WE 
04:32:22 WERE GETTING. I HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHO WE BOTH WHO HAD THINGS 
04:32:30 TO SAY ABOUT YOU AND I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT THAT, BUT WHEN I 
04:32:34 REALIZED THAT AMY WAS YOUR WIFE, AND THAT SHE AND I HAD A 
04:32:40 PREVIOUS INTERACTION AND PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIP I FELT GOOD 
04:32:44 ABOUT THAT BECAUSE AMY I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING THE

04:34:53 BECAUSE IIT WOULD HAVE BEEN A INSTITUTION THAT IT'S IN 
04:35:00 BRONZEVILLE, IT HAD BEEN STRUGGLING AND I THINK YOUR SUPPORT 
04:35:05 OF THEIR EFFORTS TO EXPAND AND BECOME A MORE CUTTING EDGE 
04:35:10 SCHOOL IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED SO I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR 
04:35:14 THAT. ALSO THE CTA GREEN LINE AND THE INVESTMENT IN THE 
04:35:18 NEIGHBORHOOD OPPORTUNITY FUNDS. I THINK ALL THE ALDERMAN HERE 
04:35:22 I PROBABLY HAVE THE MOST NOF'S AND THAT CREATED A MORE ROBUST 
04:35:28 BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN THE BRONZEVILLE COMMUNITY. I LIKE TO 
04:35:33 JUST SAY THAT YOUR ATTENTION TO THE STRUCTURAL BUDGET DEFICIT 
04:35:39 WAS AMAZING IN THAT WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR DEFICIT FROM A 
04:35:45 HIGH OF 600 AND WHATEVER IT WAS $92 MILLION OR WHATEVER IT WAS 
04:35:50 DOWN TO SOMETHING MORE MANAGEABLE. I KNOW WE STILL HAVE A 
04:35:53 WAYS TO GO, BUT THAT TOOK A LOT OF COMMITMENT FROM YOU AND 
04:35:58 FROM THE COUNCIL. YOU HIRED EXCELLENT STAFF AND YOUR 
04:36:04 APPOINTMENTS TO BOARDS LIKE THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND 
04:36:07 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION HAVE BEEN STELLAR AND I WANT 
04:36:10 TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. AND FINALLY I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT 
04:36:17 YOU HAVE MOVED THE NEEDLE FORWARD WORKING WITH ME AND ME 
04:36:21 WORKING WITH YOU AND WORKING FOR THIS COUNCIL AND THE THIRD 
04:36:24 WARD TO A BETTER PLACE AND WE ARE HAPPY ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE 
04:36:28 MORE TO DO BUT YOU ALSO MOVED THE NEEDLE IF FORWARD IN THE 
04:36:32 CITY AND YOU DINGED FOR THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD GET DINGED FOR, 
04:36:38 SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE BODY OF THE WORK AND 
04:36:42 THE BODY OF THE WORK HAS BEEN EXCELLENT AND WE THANK YOU FOR 
04:36:47 YOUR SERVICE. 
04:36:48 >> THANK YOU.

04:37:09 RESOLUTION AND ENJOYED LISTENING TO IT READ IN THE RECORD AND 
04:37:13 SURE IT BROUGHT BACK A LOT OF MEMORIES FROM YOU. TO HEAR THE 
04:37:16 TRAJECTORY OF YOUR CAREER FROM EARLY STAGES. GOING BACK TO 
04:37:22 1989 JUST OUT OF COLLEGE MY FIRST JOB OUT OF COLLEGE I WAS ON 
04:37:25 THE STAFF OF THE ILLINOIS DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THERE WERE TWO 
04:37:31 STATEWIDE ORGANIZER POSITIONS ONE I HIRED INTO AND THE OTHER 
04:37:36 YOU HAD AT THE TIME WORKING UNDER [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] I WISH 
04:37:40 HE WERE HERE TODAY. HE WOULD APPRECIATE THIS MOMENT THAT TWO 
04:37:45 OF THE YOUNG KIDS AT THE TIME HE TOOK A CHANCE ON HAVE THIS 
04:37:49 MOMENT WHERE WE HAVE BEEN LEAD TO WHERE WE CAN TALK ABOUT SOME 
04:37:52 OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE SHARED SOME THINGS WE HAVE BEEN 
04:37:56 ABLE TO DO TOGETHER. MR. PRESIDENT YOU SAID SOME MONTHS AGO 
04:38:01 YOUR GOAL WAS TO RUN THROUGH THE TAPE, WELL, YOU CERTAINLY 
04:38:05 ACHIEVED THAT IN DRAMATIC FASHION. EVEN YOUR STRONGEST 
04:38:09 CRITICS COULDN'T DO NIGH WHAT WE DID TODAY AND ALL THE 
04:38:12 ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT SO MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE 
04:38:18 HIGHLIGHTED THAT IS YOUR LEGACY. YOU LIKE TO SAY THAT THEY 
04:38:21 DON'T BUILD STATUES TO PEOPLE WHO BALANCE BUDGETS. THAT IS 
04:38:25 TRUE. NOT SURE THEY WILL BUILD STATUES TO POLITICIANS AGAIN 
04:38:28 NO MATTER WHAT WE ACCOMPLISH, BUT THERE IS SO MUCH YOU ARE 
04:38:31 ABLE TO ACHIEVE IN THE 8 YEARS AS MAYOR. I WANT TO BRING 
04:38:34 FORTH ONE THAT HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED HERE TODAY AND IT IS 
04:38:38 BECAUSE IT TIES INTO YOUR ENTIRE CAREER. IT ST. THE 606. THE 
04:38:42 BLOOMING DALE TRAIL BACK WHEN YOU WERE IN CONGRESS IS WHAT IT 
04:38:46 WAS CALLED AND IT WAS YOUR LEADERSHIP AND VISION AND HARD WORK 
04:38:49 AND TENACITY WHILE IN CONGRESS THAT MADE THAT REALTY TODAY AND 
04:38:57 IT IS FITTING AND APPROPRIATE ONE OF THE FINAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
04:39:01 IS THE LINCOLN YARDS PROJECT WHICH WILL COMPLETE THAT 606 AND 
04:39:05 ALLOW IT TO SPAN THE CHICAGO RIVER, KENNEDY EXPRESSWAY, THE 
04:39:11 TRACKS, ANOTHER 3 QUARTERS CONNECT LOGAN SQUARE AND LAKE FRONT 
04:39:18 TRAIL. THAT IS AN EXCLAMATION POINTS ON ALL THE ACHIEVEMENTS 
04:39:25 THAT YOU RIGHTLY CLAIM CREDIT FOR DURING YOUR 8 YEARS OF MAYOR 
04:39:28 AND PROUD TO PLAY A SMALL PART OF THAT. I SALUTE FOR 
04:39:31 EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE AND YOU AND AMY WISH YOU NOTHING BUT

04:43:07 PERSONA IS--YOU CAN TURN INTO A CHARACTER AND THEN YOU READ 
04:43:12 ABOUT THE CHARACTER YOU BECOME AND THAT ISN'T ALWAYS 
04:43:15 REFLECTIVE OF THE HUMANITY BEHIND THAT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR

04:43:25 PRESIDENT IT HAS BEEN A HONOR TO SERVE WITH YOU, THANK YOU FOR 
04:43:28 YOUR SERVICE TO THE CITY ANDRY. I THINK THE WORLD CHANGED 
04:43:35 NOVEMBER 2016 AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE BEHAVING IN WAYS THAT THEY 
04:43:40 NORMALLY WOULDN'T BEHAVING ON THE BASE INSTINCT AS THE MAYOR

04:43:52 YOU FOR STANDING UP FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE. IT HAS BEEN A 
04:43:55 HONOR TO SERVE WITH YOU AND HOPE TO SEE YOU AROUND THE

04:44:08 BEEN SAID BY EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS TO SAY IT. FIRST AMY KNOWS 
04:44:12 THIS, IF I LEAVE MY GRAND PARENTS TO THE END I'LL START 
04:44:19 CRYING--[INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] AND GRANDMA SOPHIE, MAY YOU REST

04:44:44 [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SHARE 
04:44:46 THIS RESOLUTION WITH YOU. AND FOR A WONDERFUL LIFE TOGETHER. 
04:44:55 I KNOW I COULDN'T GET THROUGH GRANDMA AND GRAND PA. IT IS MY 
04:45:00 LAST CITY COUNCIL MEETING AS MAYOR. ON MAY 18, 2011 AND 
04:45:07 SAID, "WE HAVE DIFFICULT THINGS TO DO BUT I BELIEVE BY WORKING 
04:45:11 TOGETHER BEING HONEST WITH EACH OTHER, AND FACING THE CHOICES 
04:45:16 WE HAVE TO FACE WE CAN HANDLE THESE CHALLENGES BECAUSE IN 
04:45:24 EVERY ONE OF THESE CHALLENGES ARE OPPORTUNITIES. THE 
04:45:28 OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THE BIG THINGS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED 
04:45:31 US", 8 YEARS AGO I MADE A PLEDGE TO WORK WITH THIS COUNCIL AND 
04:45:41 CHICAGO IN GOOD WIG AND GOOD FAITH. I MADE A PLEDGE TO WORK 
04:45:46 TOGETHER IN COMMON CAUSE TOWARDS MORE STABLE FINANCES FOR OUR 
04:45:49 CITY, STRONGER SCHOOLS FOR OUR CHILDREN, AND SAFER STREETS FOR 
04:45:56 OUR RESIDENTS. AS YOU KNOW IN PUBLIC SERVICES AND PRIVATE 
04:46:00 LIVES OUR WORK IS NEVER DONE. THERE IS ALWAYS ANOTHER HILL TO 
04:46:04 CLIME. THERE ALWAYS ANOTHER OBSTACLE TO OVERCOME AND IN OUR 
04:46:08 CASE THERE IS ALWAYS ANOTHER ORDINANCE PASSED. THERE IS NO 
04:46:13 FINISH LINE IN THE RACE FOR PROGRESS. OUR JOB AND 
04:46:17 RESPONSIBILITY IS TO DO THE BEST WE CAN TO LEAVE THE THINGS 
04:46:21 BETTER WHEN WE WALK OUT THE DOOR THEN THEY WERE WHEN WE WALKED 
04:46:25 IN THE DOOR. AND THEN THE PASS THE TORCH. OVER THE COURSE OF 
04:46:30 8 YEARS WE DID NOT ALWAYS GET IT ALWAYS RIGHT, BUT WE ALWAYS 
04:46:34 HAD THE RIGHT INTENTION. BECAUSE WE WORKED TOGETHER, BECAUSE 
04:46:39 WE WERE MOST IMPORTANTLY HONEST TO EACH OTHER AND BECAUSE WE 
04:46:42 FACED OUR CHOICES AND CHALLENGES HEAD ON WITH CANDOR AND 
04:46:47 COURAGE, CHICAGO AND CHICAGOANS ARE IN A BETTER AND STRONGER 
04:46:53 PLACE TODAY TO MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR TOMORROW. NOT ONLY IS 
04:46:59 CITY FINANCES ON A FIRMER FOOTING THEN THEY WERE 8 YEARS AGO, 
04:47:03 BUT AS WE CAN SEE THE FISCAL CONDITION IS NO LONGER A DRAG OR 
04:47:07 THREAT TO THE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB CREATION HAPPENING IN 
04:47:13 THE CITY. NOT ONLY IS CRIME FALLING, A CREDIT TO THE 
04:47:18 LEADERSHIP OF SUPERINTENDANT JOHNSON [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] 
04:47:27 UNDERGOING REFORMS THAT WILL STAND THE TEST OF TIME. NOT ONLY 
04:47:32 IS CHICAGO DECADE LONG BATTLE FOR FAIR FUNDING FOR CHILDREN 
04:47:36 AND SCHOOLS OVER, BUT CHICAGO STUDENTS ARE MAKING OUR CITY 
04:47:42 PROUD AND SHOWING THE WHOLE WORLD WHAT IS POSSIBLE WITH RECORD 
04:47:46 HIGH GRADUATION RATES AND UNPARALLEL ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. 
04:47:53 WHEN THAT MANY CHILDREN MAKE THAT MUCH PROGRESS IT MEANS THE 
04:47:58 WHOLE CITY IS DOING SOMETHING RIGHT TOGETHER. THINK ABOUT 
04:48:02 THIS, A CHILD WHO IS BORN IN CHICAGO TODAY WILL GET 4 MORE 
04:48:09 YEARS OF WORTH OF SCHOOL THEN A CHILD BORN A DECADE AGO. 
04:48:28 RIVER WALK, MORE PLAINLY THEN WE CAN SEE THE IMPACT OF 
04:48:31 UNIVERSAL PREK FOR EVERY 4 YEAR OLD, A FULL DAY OF 
04:48:37 KINDERGARTEN FOR EVERY 5 YEAR OLD. A FULL SCHOOL DAY AND 
04:48:40 SCHOOL YEAR FOR EVERY CHILD. FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THROUGH 
04:48:43 THE STAR SCHOLARSHIP. FOR THE LIFE ALTERING IMPACT OF A 
04:48:48 MENTOR. THOSE INVESTMENTS WILL BE THE MOST LASTING AND MOST 
04:48:53 IMPACTFUL AND THE LIFE OF OUR CHILDREN AND CITY. I KNOW IT 
04:48:58 WOULD BE OUT OF CHARACTER FOR ME TO GO TWO MINUTES WITHOUT A 
04:49:02 POLITICAL POINT BECAUSE I'M HAVING A OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE 
04:49:08 RIGHT NOW. IT SHOULD NOT BE LOST ON ANY OF US THAT THOSE WHO 
04:49:17 STOOD IN THE WAY OF SOME OF THOSE GAINS AND TRY NOW THAT I 
04:49:23 DEPART TO ROLL THEM BACK. WE CANNOT GO BACK TO THE DAYS OF 
04:49:28 ENDLESS FINANCIAL AND ACADEMIC CRISIS AT THE CHICAGO PUBLIC 
04:49:35 SCHOOLS BOTH OF WHICH WE HELPED BRING TO A END. WE CANNOT GO 
04:49:39 BACK TO THE SHORTER SCHOOL DAY AND SCHOOL YEAR IN THE UNITED 
04:49:42 STATES OF AMERICA. WE CANNOT GO BACK TO THE DAYS WHERE THE 
04:49:46 U.S. SECRETARY OF EDUCATION ONCE CALLED CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
04:49:52 THE WORST IN THE COUNTRY. IF I ASK AS YOUR MAYOR FOR THE 
04:49:56 REMAINING 4 WEEKS ONE LAST FAVOR OF EACH OF YOU, I ASK YOU 
04:50:03 STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH OW MAYOR ELECT. SHE WILL NEED 
04:50:09 YOUR SUPPORT TO KEEP OUR STUDENTS AND SCHOOLS MOVING IN THE 
04:50:13 SAME RIGHT DIRECTION. STAND UNITED WITH HER INTO THE DEFENSE 
04:50:18 OF THE HARD GAINS. DO NOT ALLOW THOSE WHO STOOD IN THE WAY OF 
04:50:24 PROGRESS TO REVERSE THE PROGRESS WE COLLECTIVELY MADE OVER THE 
04:50:28 LAST 8 YEARS. MY FIRST COUNCIL MEETING AS MAYOR 8 YEARS AGO I 
04:50:35 TOOK THE OCCASION TO QUOTE YOGI BERRA WHO SAID, WHEN YOU COME 
04:50:40 TO A FORK IN THE ROAD, TAKE IT. TODAY IN MY LAST COUNCIL 
04:50:46 MEETING AS MAYOR IT IS THE WORDS OF ANOTHER BASEBALL GREAT 
04:50:51 THAT RING IN MY EAR, 80 YEARS AGO LOU GEHRIG SAID TODAY I FEEL

04:51:04 MONTH AND IF YOU KNOW ME WHICH YOU DO, YOU KNOW THAT I'LL MAKE

04:51:22 THE CITY OF CHICAGO, THE GREATEST CITY IN THE GREATEST COUNTRY

04:56:34 >> ALDERMAN O'CONNOR. 
04:56:36 >> MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL, I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS AND BEING 
04:56:42 ONE OF THE SUBJECTS I AND R WISH TO MAKE A COUPLE PERSONAL 
04:56:47 OBSERVATIONS. FIRST AND FOREMOST, I WANT TO THANK THE 
04:56:50 COLLEAGUES THAT I SERVED IN THE CHAMBER WITH PAST AND PRESENT. 
04:56:55 I HAD THE PRIVILEGE SERVING WITH WONDERFUL PEOPLE. GREAT 
04:57:02 GREAT LEGISLATORS AND SOME FOLK WHO CARED ABOUT THE CITY OF 
04:57:06 CHICAGO. AND WHILE ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN AN EXAMPLE NOT ALL 
04:57:11 HAVE BEEN A GOOD EXAMPLE AND SO YOU LEARN FROM YOUR COLLEAGUES 
04:57:16 BOTH WHAT TO DO AND OFTEN TIMES WHAT NOT TO DO. WHEN I JOINED 
04:57:22 THIS COUNCIL I WAS MUCH YOUNGER MAN, I HAD DARKER HAIR, MORE 
04:57:27 OF IT. I FIGURED THIS MORNING WHEN I JUMPED OFF THE SCALE I 
04:57:33 PUT ON ABOUT A POUND AND A HALF FOR EVERY YEAR I HAVE BEEN 
04:57:38 HERE. THAT DIDN'T COME IN EQUAL INCREMENTS SO I HAVE TO TELL 
04:57:42 YOU ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I'LL DO LEAVING THE CHAMBERS IS 
04:57:49 TRY TO USE SOME OF THE LAST FEW INCREMENTS I ACQUIRED OVER THE 
04:57:53 LAST COUPLE YEARS. I SAID THAT I HAD DARK HAIR AND MY 
04:58:00 COLLEAGUE ALDERMAN LORENO CAME HERE WITH DARK HILL AND STILL 
04:58:04 HAS DARK HAIR SO-WHICH IS A GREAT THING. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, 
04:58:12 I NEVER SAT IN THIS CHAIR WITHOUT SITTING NEXT TO A LORENO AND 
04:58:19 WHEN I FIRST JOINED THE COUNCIL HER DAD ALDERMAN ROADY, 
04:58:25 OTHERS, ALDERMAN STONE, COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE WELCOMING AND 
04:58:29 I LEARNED THAT WHEN YOU SERVE WITH PEOPLE THE FIRST THING YOU 
04:58:35 DO IS BE WELCOMED BECAUSE THIS IS A HARD JOB FOR ALL OF US. 
04:58:40 I'M NOT BEEFING T-R IT IS A JOB WE SIGN UP FOR SO YOU CAN'T 
04:58:44 SIT AND WHINE ABOUT WHAT IT IS, BUT YOU CAN TELL THE TRUTH AND 
04:58:47 RECOGNIZE IT IS A HARD JOB. YOU CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT A FULL 
04:58:53 COMMITMENT AND THE COMMITMENT IS NOT JUST OURS, THE COMMITMENT 
04:58:57 IS THAT OF OUR FAMILIES. I BLESSED WITH A GOOD WIFE AND 5 
04:59:02 KIDS WHO HAVE LIVED A LITTLE IN A FISH BOWL ALL THEIR LIVES. 
04:59:06 I NOW HAVE 7 GRAND KIDS WHO WILL NOT BE IN THE FISH BOWL AND 
04:59:11 THAT'S NOT A BAD THING. I HOPE THEY BEHAVE AS WELL AS MINE 
04:59:15 DID WHEN THEY THOUGHT THE EYES OF THE WORLD WERE ON THEM. 
04:59:20 THEY COULDN'T GO IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS SOMEBODY DIDN'T KNOW WHO 
04:59:23 THEY WERE AND COULDN'T GET A CALL IF SOMETHING WAS GOING WRONG 
04:59:26 OR NOT. THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT GREAT RIDE. THE LAST 8 YEARS 
04:59:32 WONDERFUL. THANK YOU ALL. 
04:59:35 (APPLAUSE) 
04:59:38 >> BEFORE I RECOGNIZE ANYONE OF YOU, BECAUSE OF SOME AMY AND I 
05:00:04 HAVE TO DO, I WANT TO JUST SAY SPEAK OUT OF ORDER. WITH A JOB 
05:00:09 COMES TO A END BUT RELATIONSHIP AND PERSONAL FRIENDSHIPS ENDUR 
05:00:14 AND IN THE SPIRIT OF FRIENDSHIP I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR 
05:00:19 YOUR SERVICE TO THE CITY AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO HOLD YOUR 
05:00:24 HEAD HIGH AS YOU WALK OUT THE DOORS FOR THE IMPRINT YOU MADE 
05:00:28 ON THE FUTURE OF THIS GREAT CITY. I DO WANT TO ALSO TAKE THE 
05:00:31 TIME TO CALL OUT PAT O'CONNOR. MARGE AND JILL. I HAVE A 
05:00:42 STORY FOR EACH OF OUR FRIENDSHIPS AND WORKING RELATIONSHIPS GO 
05:00:46 BACK TO CONGRESS, GO BACK TO BEING MAYOR. MOST IMPORTANTLY I 
05:00:49 CAN TALK A STORY ABOUT MARGE AND BLOOD [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS]

05:01:06 IT ON THE PHONE AND IT WAS THE FIRST FEMA GRANT GRANTED BY 
05:01:09 ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION. PAT AND I WHICH NOW HAS ITS OWN 
05:01:17 PERSONAL TUNNEL SO THERE IS NO FLOODING. PAT AND I TOOK A 
05:01:19 PLACE ON ROSEVILLE CEMETERY. WHAT PAT DID THERE [INAUDIBLE 
05:01:28 COMMENTS] WILL REMAIN IN THE HISTORY BOOKS NOT TO BE REPEATED 
05:01:30 FOR THE RECORD BUT IT IS NOW A NATURE PRESERVE ON THE LARGEST 
05:01:35 NATURE PRESERVE IN A URBAN NEIGHBORHOOD SETTING. ALDERMAN 
05:01:41 MOORE AND I WHO WORKED TIRELESSLY TO PUT A IMPRINT [INAUDIBLE 
05:01:50 COMMENTS] THINGS THAT WERE NEVER DONE AND TALKED ABOUT FOR 
05:01:54 YEARS. ALL YOU--YOUR PARENTS, YOUR HUSBAND AND WIVES, YOUR 
05:02:02 FAMILY MEMBERS, YOU HAVE A INCREDIBLE IMPRINT ON YOUR 
05:02:08 NEIGHBORHOOD AND COMMUNITY AND IN THE LIFE AND WELL PP BEING 
05:02:12 OF THE CITY. WE SHOULD ALL BE PROUD OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND 
05:02:17 THINK OF THE MOMENT FOR US AS THE FAMOUS QUOTE BY TEDDY 
05:02:22 ROOSEVELT, ABOUT IT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CRITIC AND SOMEBODY 
05:02:28 WILLING TO TAKE RISKS. SOMEBODY WHO [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] 
05:02:34 SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS THE PLEASURE OF THE SWEAT AND DIRT IN THEIR 
05:02:38 EYE UNLIKE THOSE TIMED SOULS WHO ARE CRITICS AND SIT AND MAKE 
05:02:44 JUDGMENTS ON OTHERS. I HOPE TO ALL OF YOU WHO ARE PUBLIC 
05:02:49 SERVANTS AND LEAVE THIS CHAPTER, KNOW IN ONE OF THE GREAT 
05:02:54 PRESIDENT YOU WERE NOT A TIMED SOUL. YOU ARE ONE OF THE 
05:02:59 COURAGEOUS. WE TOOK A PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL RISK, GAVE UP 
05:03:05 YOUR CENTRAL AND YOU WERE IN THE ARENA TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
05:03:08 AND BECAUSE OF THAT SPIRIT OUR CITY, YOUR RESPECTIVE 
05:03:12 NEIGHBORHOOD, YOUR RESIDENTS ARE IN A BETTER PLACE AND TO ALL 
05:03:16 ALL THE OTHERS WHO MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT YOUR WORK THE 
05:03:20 DIFFERENCES YOU GAVE OF YOURSELF, BODY, SOUL, SPIRIT. THANK 
05:03:28 YOU. 
05:03:29 (APPLAUSE) ALDERMAN JOE MOORE. ALDERMAN OSTERMAN. 
05:03:46 >> THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME GO BEFORE JOE BECAUSE WE WILL BE 
05:03:51 HERE BEFORE 6. JOE LIKES TO GO ON AND ON AND ONE THING HE'LL 
05:03:56 TEACH THE NEW ALDERMAN IS NEVER RESPOND ON A FACEBOOK POST 
05:04:00 BECAUSE YOU WILL BE UP TO 300 IN THE MORNING. THE ELECTION 
05:04:09 DEVASTATED THE ROLL BACK HERE. HOPEFULLY JAMES WILL BE 
05:04:14 STICKING AROUND BUT I HAD A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH 
05:04:16 MANY COLLEAGUES. JOE MOORE AND I SHARED ROGER PARK AS A STATE 
05:04:21 REPRESENTATIVE AND WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER. HIM AND HIS WIFE 
05:04:25 AND FAMILY HIS SON IS HERE NOW. HE'S DONE A LOT OF GREAT 
05:04:28 THINGS OVER HIS 27 YEAR CAREER THAT MADE ROGER'S PARK A BETTER 
05:04:34 PLACE AND SOMEONE WHO HAD A FRONT ROW VIEW I WANT TO THANK YOU 
05:04:38 AND YOUR FAMILY FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO ROGER'S PARK. I KNOW 
05:04:41 WHAT YOU DID. YOU DID A PHENOMENAL JOB AND MADE IT A BETTER 
05:04:46 NEIGHBORHOOD. I HAD THE GREAT DISTINCTION WORKING WITH PAT 
05:04:49 O'CONNOR FOR A LONG TIME. HIS BROTHER AND I WENT TO HIGH 
05:04:57 SCHOOL TOGETHER AND THE THING ABOUT PAT IS IT IS A FAMILY 
05:05:00 OPERATION IN THE 40 WARD AND THAT SOMETIMES GETS LOST IN THE 
05:05:08 POLITICS TODAY WHERE NEIGHBORS DONT KNOW NEIGHBORS AND IT IS 
05:05:11 EASIER TO E-MAIL A COMPLAINT AT 2 A.M. THEN TALKING TO SOMEONE 
05:05:16 SIDE BY SIDE. IN THE 40 WARD OVER PAT'S MANY YEARS HE'S 
05:05:23 REALLY MADE THE NEIGHBORHOOD AN INCREDIBLE PLACE TO LIVE. ON 
05:05:27 SCHOOLS, ON SAFETY, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THINGS THAT PEOPLE 
05:05:33 DON'T REMEMBER WHEN YOU WALK INTO HIS WARD OFFICE IT IS A 
05:05:38 SMILE AND A FRIENDLY FACE AND THE STAFF HE HAS IS 
05:05:43 PROFESSIONAL. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THOUGH IS HIS FAMILY 
05:05:47 AND WHAT HE'S DONE OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME TO RAISE A GREAT 
05:05:51 FAMILY. ALWAYS PUTTING THEM FIRST AND KEEPING PERSPECTIVE 
05:05:57 POSITIVE BECAUSE THE WORK YOU DO THE ELECTION SOMETIMES DON'T 
05:06:00 MATTER AND RESULTS DON'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE WORK YOU DO, AND 
05:06:04 THE OTHER THOUSAND ACTS OF KINDNESS TO PEOPLE IN THE 
05:06:10 COMMUNITY-THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS THIS-YOU GO TO HIS WARD 
05:06:13 OFFICE YOU FIND OUT ABOUT PAT THAT HE IS A JOHN WAYNE BUFF. 
05:06:21 TODAY HE WILL GO OUT LIKE A COWBOY. I WANT TO READ A JOHN 
05:06:26 WAYNE QUOTE. "TRY TO LIVE MY LIFE SO MY FAMILY WOULD LOVE ME, 
05:06:33 MY FRIENDS WOULD RESPECT ME, AND THE OTHER SAID CAN DO 
05:06:36 WHATEVER THE HELL THEY PLEASE ". PAT, GOD BLESS. 
05:06:43 >> ALDERMAN MOORE. 
05:06:46 >> I WAS KIND OF A DIFFERENT KIDS. MOST KIDS THEIR SPORTS 
05:06:56 HEROES WERE BALL PLAYERS OR MUSIC STARS. MY HEROES HER 
05:07:04 POLITICIANS. GEORGE [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] HUBERT HUMPHRY. 
05:07:08 [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] THOSE ARE PEOPLE I LOOKED UP TO AND 
05:07:12 DREAMED MAYBE ONE DAY I TOO MIGHT BE ABLE TO HOLD ELECTIVE 
05:07:16 OFFICE AND TRY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND FOR 28 YEARS I HAD 
05:07:19 THAT HONOR. I ACHIEVED MY CHILDHOOD DREAM OF HOLDING PUBLIC 
05:07:25 OFFICE AND SERVING PEOPLE. IT HAS BEEN A WONDERFUL WONDERFUL 
05:07:31 RIDE AND I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF THE 49TH WARD GIVING ME 
05:07:35 THAT OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT THEM. I WANT TO CONGRATULATE MY 
05:07:42 SUCCESSOR MARIA HADEN AND URGE YOU TO HELP AND GIVE HER 
05:07:50 GUIDANCE THE WAY YOUR PREDECESSORS GAVE TO ME WHEN I TOOK 
05:07:54 OFFICE. IRONICALLY ON MAY 20, 1991. ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU. 
05:08:02 FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE TWO PEOPLE WHO PRECEDED ME HERE IN 
05:08:07 THE COUNCIL. THERE ARE ONLY TWO LEFT. ED BURKE AND PAT 
05:08:13 O'CONNOR. WE STARTED OUT IN DIFFERENT SIDES POLITICALLY BUT 
05:08:19 OVER THE YEARS I LEARNED TO COME AS FRIENDS AS PEOPLE WHO 
05:08:29 SHARED LOVE OF PUBLIC SERVICE. I WANT TO PARTICULARLY 
05:08:32 ACKNOWLEDGE PAT O'CONNOR WHO I HAVE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF 
05:08:37 RESPECT FOR NOW. TOGETHER WITH ALDERMAN SILVERSTEIN AND 
05:08:42 O'CONNOR WERE NEIGHBORS IN MY WARD, AND I REALLY HAVE GROWN-A 
05:08:50 LOT OF-YOU LEARN A LOT IN 28 YEARS AND ONE THING I LEARNED WAS 
05:08:56 FROM PAT. VERY FEW THINGS ARE A BLACK AND WHITE. GOOD AND 
05:09:01 BAD. USUALLY THEY ARE SHADES OF GRAY AND YOU TRY TO WALK 
05:09:05 THAT-YOU TRY TO FIND THAT COMPROMISE THAT PEOPLE CAN LIVE WITH 
05:09:10 AND I WANT TO THANK YOU PAT. I WANT TO THANK YOU MARGE. WE 
05:09:15 HAD A GREAT TIME TOGETHER. SHARED A LOT OF LAUGHS, AND BOTH 
05:09:25 PAT AND YOU AND I SERVED ON NATIONAL LEGAL OF CITIES SO HAD 
05:09:29 OUR TASTE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND IT HAS BIB A WONDERFUL 
05:09:32 RIDE WITH YOU AND PAT IN THE CITY COUNCIL. WE HEARD A LOT OF 
05:09:50 PEOPLE APPRECIATED IN THE MOTION WAY [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] I 
05:09:56 THINK GOTTEN A LOT OF UNFAIR CRITICISM AND BAD BREAKS WHEN 
05:10:03 PEOPLE DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT AND THINK OVER 
05:10:05 TIME HISTORY WILL SHOW THAT MAYOR EMANUEL WAS ONE OF OUR GREAT 
05:10:10 MAYORS. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MAYOR DALEY AS I SAID WE HAD 
05:10:14 OUR DIFFERENCES ON POLICY BUT NO ONE CAN OUTMATCH THE LOVE FOR 
05:10:19 THE CITY AND HE SERVED THE CITY WELL FOR MANY MANY YEARS. AND 
05:10:24 FINALLY, I WANT TO THANK MY WIFE BARBARA WHO BECAUSE SHE HAS A 
05:10:31 CAREER OF HER OWN HAD TO GO OUT AND TAKE A CALL, BUT SHE'S IN 
05:10:36 THE ROOM AND HOPEFULLY HEARS ME. SHE'S BEEN A GREAT PARTNER 
05:10:41 AND MADE ME A BETTER PERSON AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY SONS. 
05:10:46 BOTH OF THEM HAVE ONLY KNOWN THEIR FATHER AS ALDERMAN. MY 
05:10:51 OLDEST SON NATHAN WHO IS IN WASHINGTON DC RIGHT NOW WAS BORN 
05:10:57 THE DAY BEFORE I ANNOUNCED FOR ALDERMAN. MY SON ZACHARY WHO 
05:11:02 HONORED WITH ME WITH HIS PRESENCE TODAY-ZACK- 
05:11:06 (APPLAUSE) 
05:11:08 THERE ARE A LOT OF SACRIFICES OF BEING A SON A CHILD OF AN 
05:11:19 ELECTED OFFICIAL. TO THIS DAY I NEVER HEARD ANYONE SAY 
05:11:23 ANYTHING BAD ABOUT MY FATHER AND MOTHER. NOTHING AT ALL. 
05:11:26 ONLY GOOD THINGS. MY TWO BOYS DIDN'T HAVE THAT LUXURY. BUT, 
05:11:38 THEY STUCK WITH ME AND IN THE LAST CAMPAIGN BOTH OF THEM MY 
05:11:43 SON ZACHARY IN PARTICULAR WORKED VERY VERY HARD KNOCKING ON 
05:11:46 DOORS AND IN COLD WEATHER. I THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING MY 
05:11:55 COLLEAGUES. FOR REALLY CARING ABOUT YOUR WARD AND COMMUNITY. 
05:12:00 I THINK EVERYONE IN YOUR CONSTITUENTS SHOULD HAVE HEARD YOUR 
05:12:04 COMMENTS TODAY. IT IS OBVIOUS HOW MUCH YOU CARE ABOUT THE 
05:12:07 PEOPLE YOU SERVE AND ABOUT THE COMMUNITY YOU REPRESENT AND 
05:12:09 ABOUT THE CITY AS A WHOLE. I SHARE THAT PASSION. I DON'T 
05:12:14 KNOW WHAT THE NEXT CHAPTER HOLDS BUT I KNOW I'LL BE AROUND. 
05:12:18 I'M NOT GOING TO BE A STRANGER AND HOPE OUR PATHS CONTINUE TO 
05:12:22 CROSS. THANK YOU FOR SERVING WITH ME. 
05:12:26 (APPLAUSE) 
05:12:27 >> ALDERMAN BEALE. 
05:12:35 >> THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I WANTED TO RISE AND SAY A FEW 
05:12:41 WORDS ABOUT THIS RESOLUTION TO BASICALLY SAY THAT IT HAS BEEN 
05:12:48 A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH EACH AND OVER ONE OF YOU ALL OVER THE 
05:12:52 YEARS. WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE I HAD NO PUBLIC EXPERIENCE, NO 
05:12:57 KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CITY GOVERNMENT, AND I LEANED ON QUITE A FEW 
05:13:02 OF YOU ALL TO HELP LEAD THE WAY FOR ME AND SO WHEN I LOOK BACK 
05:13:06 NOW 20 YEARS LATER BEING IN [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] SEEMS WEIRD 
05:13:14 WHEN YOU LOOK HOW THINGS CHANGE BUT PUBLIC SERVICE ISN'T TO BE 
05:13:20 TAKEN LIGHTLY. WHEN YOU ARE A PUBLIC OFFICIAL YOU GIVE UP 
05:13:23 YOUR FAMILY, YOU GIVE UP YOUR PRIVATE LIFE, YOU GIVE UP SO 
05:13:27 MUCH, AND PEOPLE DONT REALIZE THE SACRIFICE YOU MAKE JUST TO 
05:13:32 BE A PUBLIC SERVANT. FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART I WANT TO 
05:13:36 THANK EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU FOR GIVING OF YOURSELF AND 
05:13:42 FAMILY AND EVERYTHING TO MAKE YOUR COMMUNITY A BETTER PLACE TO 
05:13:48 LIVE AND PLAY. TO MARGE, LET ME JUST SAY REAL QUICK, I ALWAYS 
05:13:54 ADMIRED THE FACT HOW YOU WOULD RUN YOUR COMMITTEE. YOU NEVER 
05:14:01 WANTED ANY TROUBLE. YOU NEVER WANTED PROBLEMS AND YOU SAID 
05:14:05 SOLVE THE PROBLEMS BEFORE IT COMES TO MY COMMITTEE. YOU SAY 
05:14:08 WORK IT OUT. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY PROBLEM. WE ALWAYS 
05:14:12 TRIED TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY IN YOUR COMMITTEE BUT OTHER 
05:14:16 COMMITTEES WE TRIED TO WORK OUT THOSE PROBLEMS SO WE DON'T 
05:14:19 HAVE ANY PROBLEMS. I ALWAYS ADMIRED THAT ABOUT YOU. 
05:14:24 >> THANK YOU. 
05:14:25 >> LET ME SAY ONE OTHER THING, THERE IS NOBODY IN THIS BODY 
05:14:29 THAT I HAVE SEEN THAT WALKS LIKE THEY ARE WALKING ON A CLOUD 
05:14:34 LIKE MARGE. 
05:14:36 [LAUGHTER] 
05:14:38 SHE HAS THE STRUT LIKE YOU NEVER SEEN BEFORE LIKE, I'M JUST 
05:14:45 WALKING ON A CLOUD, NO WORRIES, NO PROBLEMS. I HAVE A ALWAYS 
05:14:54 WATCHED YOU WALK BECAUSE OF HOW YOU DID IT. 
05:14:57 >> OKAY. 
05:14:58 >> SO, THAT IS TO BE COMMENDED BECAUSE THAT MEANS YOU HAVE NO 
05:15:04 WEIGHT ON YOUR SHOULDERS. 
05:15:05 >> NOT ANYMORE. 
05:15:08 >> TO MY FRIEND PAT, I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SERVING WITH YOUR 
05:15:12 PAT FOR 20 YEARS, AND THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MORE SOLID PERSON 
05:15:19 IN THIS BODY TO SERVE WITH OTHER THEN YOU. WE HAVE HAD SO 
05:15:25 MONEY LAUGHS TOGETHER. NO MATTER WHAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH I 
05:15:29 KNOW I CAN ALWAYS GO TO PAT AND WE WOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF 
05:15:33 LAUGH ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS BODY. AND WHEN PAT 
05:15:37 DECIDED-I REMEMBER PAT SAID I'M REALLY THINKING ABOUT NOT 
05:15:42 RUNNING, BUT HIS DESIRE TO CONTINUE TO SERVE AND SEE THINGS 
05:15:47 THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE IN HIS WARD HE SAW HE NEEDED TO 
05:15:52 CONTINUE TO GIVE UP HISSELF EVEN THOUGH HE WANTED TO RETIRE SO 
05:15:56 THAT GOES TO SHOW YOUR HEART, PASSION AND DEDICATION TO YOUR 
05:15:59 COMMUNITY. THOSE ARE THE TRAITS IF WE ALL CAN TAKE A LITTLE 
05:16:04 BIT OF THE PEOPLE WHO CONTINUE TO GIVE OF THEMSELVES, THIS 
05:16:12 PLACE WILL BE A BETTER CITY OF CHICAGO SO I WANT TO THANK ALL 
05:16:15 YOU. PAT YOU HAVE BEEN SODDED. I'M GOING TO WISH YOU AND 
05:16:21 YOUR WARD WILL MISS YOU AND WE WILL BE HERE AND IF YOU EVER 
05:16:26 NEED A LAUGH YOU KNOW HOW TO CALL. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GOD 
05:16:29 BLESS YOU. 
05:16:31 (APPLAUSE) 
05:16:32 >> ALDERMAN SILVERSTEIN. 
05:16:35 >> THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I AM HERE TO WISH FAIR WELL TO MY 
05:16:45 COLLEAGUES. I HAVE BEEN HONORED AND PRIVILEGED TO WORK WITH 
05:16:49 ALL OF YOU AND I WANT TO WISH YOU ONLY THE BEST AND HOPE THAT 
05:16:54 YOU WON'T BE GONE, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE AROUND WHEN WE NEED YOU.

05:17:04 VERY SAD DAY FOR ME. PAT, MARGE, AND JOE ALL THREE OF YOU ARE 
05:17:11 LEAVING ME. BUT I WANTED TO THANK YOU. YOU HAVE BEEN THERE 
05:17:17 FOR ME FROM DAY ONE OPENING YOUR DOORS WITH YOUR ADVICE AND 
05:17:22 GUIDANCE. JOE BEFORE DAY ONE YOU WERE THERE FOR ME SITTING 
05:17:26 TALKING WITH ME THROUGH COUNCIL. I'M GOING TO MISS YOU BUT 
05:17:31 YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU ALL AND I WANT TO WISH YOU ONLY THE VERY 
05:17:34 VERY BEST AND I KNOW YOU ARE STILL GOING TO BE THERE FOR ME SO 
05:17:39 DON'T EXPECT TO GO TOO FAR BECAUSE I WILL BE CALLING AND 
05:17:45 ASKING QUESTIONS AND LIKE I SAID I WANT TO WISH YOU THE VERY 
05:17:48 VERY BEST. 
05:17:49 >> THANK YOU. 
05:17:51 (APPLAUSE) 
05:17:52 >> ALDERMAN DAVID MOORE.

05:18:06 LEAVING THANK YOU AGAIN AS I STATED TO THE MAYOR. WHETHER YOU

05:18:55 OPENING YOUR DOORS AND WELCOMING AND TELLING US ABOUT 
05:19:01 PARTICIPATORY BUDGET BECAUSE THAT IS A ASSET FOR ME AND MY 
05:19:06 COMMUNITY AND JUST FOR THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEEL 
05:19:09 THEY CAN SPEND THE MONEY THAT THEY WORK SO HARD TO PAY THEIR 
05:19:14 TAXES WITH, IT ADDED VALUE TO ME AND SHOWED DURING THE 
05:19:20 ELECTION BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE THING PEOPLE SAID TO ME. WE

05:38:32 SOMETHING, AND ONE THING I WANT TO SAY, YOU ALL THINK I'M VERY 
05:38:38 QUITE AND I'M NOT. I'M-THERE IS A TONY AND [INAUDIBLE 
05:38:44 COMMENTS] AND I'M SCARED OF TONY MYSELF, BUT SOME OF YOU KNOW 
05:38:49 THAT AT THE AGE OF 16 I STARTED A BUSINESS. I LOVE 
05:38:53 ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND I WAS ABLE TO USE THAT IN THIS LAST 4 
05:38:58 YEARS AND TO BRING $175 MILLION ON THE TABLE TO THE 16TH WARD 
05:39:06 BECAUSE I LOVE DOING WHAT I DO, SO I HOPE THE NEXT ALDERMAN IS 
05:39:13 GOING TO FINISH THAT OFF AND MAKE IT COME TO FRUITION. BUT 
05:39:18 ONE THING THAT I CAN SAY IN MY ENTREPRENEUR SELF WHEN I WAS 
05:39:25 16, NO EXCUSE ME, WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE AND BOUGHT A BOOK AND 
05:39:29 THE FIRST PAGE THE BOOK SAID-I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT SO ABOUT 
05:39:34 $19 YEARS OLD, AND IT SAID, IF YOU CAN MAKE A HUNDRED THOUSAND 
05:39:40 DOLLARS WORKING THEN FOR SOMEONE ELSE YOU CAN BECOME A MILL 
05:39:48 MILLIONAIRE IN YOUR OWN BUSINESS AND I WAS YEAH RIGHT, I'M 19 
05:39:53 AND NEVER MAKE A HUNDRED THOUSAND IN MY LIFE, BUT I DID. AND 
05:39:57 SO, NOW I'M YOUNG ENOUGH THAT I CAN GO ON AND DO THE BUSINESS

05:42:04 JOHN STROGER AND HE WAS THINKING WHAT WE WERE MARRIED OR 
05:42:08 SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES. IT IS LONG STORY AND SURE 
05:42:12 ALDERMAN BURNETT WILL BE TELLING THE STORY FOR MANY YEARS TO 
05:42:15 COME, BUT I ALWAYS APPRECIATED IT. SO, I WANT TO MAKE SURE 
05:42:20 THAT I MENTION THAT. CERTAINLY I WANT TO THANK EACH AND EVERY

05:42:47 O'CONNOR AND WE SAT NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER 25 YEARS AND HE IS

05:42:56 REMEMBER WORKING WITH HIM HE WAS CAMPAIGNING FOR OFFICE FOR 
05:43:00 THE FIRST TIME BEFORE I WAS ALDERMAN. HE WAS WITH MY FATHER 
05:43:06 AND WE CAMPAIGNED AT THE KOREAN STREET FESTIVAL ON BRINMAR, 
05:43:12 BARBARA WAS IN WITH US AND THE KIDS IN STROLLER. HE IS SUCH A 
05:43:18 GOOD MENTOR TO FIND OUT THINGS HAPPEN HERE AT THE HALL AND I 
05:43:22 CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THAT AND I WANT TO EXPRESS MY THANKS 
05:43:27 FOR THAT. I'M JUST GOING TO WRAP THIS UP SAYING IT IS HONOR
