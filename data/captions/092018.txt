00:05:27 >> CITIZENS. 
00:05:28 CITIZENS. 
00:05:31 [GAVEL] 
00:05:36 CITIZENS, IN TIMES LIKE THIS WE'RE LIVING IN A CHANGING TIME. 
00:05:42 HONORABLE MAYOR, I WAS SHOCKED TO HEAR THAT YOU WOULD NOT RUN. 
00:05:46 NOW THEY GO -- WHO ARE THEY GOING TO WORK ON NOW? 
00:05:50 AHA. 
00:05:53 WHERE DO THE GHETTOS GET MORE JOBS. 
00:06:00 WILL THE VIOLENCE IN THE BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD STOP? 
00:06:06 WILL WE GET AFFORDABLE HOUSING? 
00:06:09 IT'S NOT WITH THE MAYOR, IT'S WITH THESE ALDERMANS. 
00:06:15 THESE ARE THE ONE THAT SHOULD RESIGN. 
00:06:21 THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN! 
00:06:25 THE MACHINE IS IMPAIRED, CORRUPTION, NEPOTISM, RACISM, THE SWAMP HERE 
00:06:38 SHOULD BE DRAINED. 
00:06:41 AND YOU CAN'T LAY IT ON THE MAYOR ANYMORE. 
00:06:44 IF I COME BACK HERE ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO, WILL THEY HAVE JOB GOODS AND 
00:06:52 SERVICES IN THESE SO-CALLED GHETTO OF CHICAGO? 
00:06:57 WHERE RACISM STILL BE HERE IN NEPOTISM CORRUPTION? 
00:07:03 SO IT'S NOT THE MAYOR! 
00:07:05 WE HAVE YOU SAY YOU GOT A STRONG MAN AND WEAK COUNCIL. 
00:07:10 YOU GOT A WEAK COUNCIL. 
00:07:14 A WEAK WEAK COUNCIL. 
00:07:17 GET RID OF THEM! 
00:07:21 VOTE THEM OUT! 
00:07:25 SO I'M GOING TO WATCH AND YOU WATCH THIS SAGA, THIS CHICAGO IS GOING 
00:07:29 TO BE GREATER. 
00:07:31 BUT THE PROBLEM GOING TO BE SOLVED WHEN WE GET A NEW MAYOR. 
00:07:37 THE SYSTEM IS CORRUPT. 
00:07:42 THE SYSTEM MUST BE CHANGED. 
00:07:48 THE DEMOCRATIC ONE PARTY SFEM, AND THEN THEY TALK ABOUT TRUMP. 
00:07:53 THEY GOT LITTLE TRUMPS RIGHT HERE. 
00:07:59 PUTIN IS RIGHT HERE. 
00:08:01 THE SWAMP IS RIGHT HERE. 
00:08:04 IT'S NOT IN WASHINGTON DC. 
00:08:05 IT'S RIGHT HERE. 
00:08:08 LET'S MAKE CHICAGO GREAT AGAIN BY VOTING OUT THESE ALDERMEN. 
00:08:18 KHAIT SYSTEM. 
00:08:21 LET'S HAVE A TWO-PARTY CITY, A CHECK AND BALANCE. 
00:08:25 A TWO-PARTY CITY. 
00:08:28 MAY GOD BLESS EACH ONE OF YOU AND IN RETURN. 
00:08:32 >> THANK YOU MR. BLAKEMOORE. 
00:08:39 >> THAT MAKES YOU GREAT AGAIN. 
00:08:42 >> NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN CATANSARA. 
00:08:48 >> SO TWO MONTHS AGO, I WAS HERE AND I SPOKE ABOUT THE POLICE DETAIL 
00:08:54 AT THE RESIDENTS OF CARDINAL. 
00:08:56 NOT A SINGLE MEMBER OF THIS BODY REALLY GAVE A GAM HALF MILLION 
00:09:03 DOLLARS A YEAR BEING GIVEN TO THIS CHICAGO CATHOLIC CHURCH. 
00:09:11 ALDERMAN MY ALDERMAN CABARSA, DOES NOT CARE. 
00:09:20 IT'S LUDICROUS THAT YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS OF 
00:09:24 POLICE MONEY TO PROTECT THE CARDINAL'S RESIDENCE. 
00:09:34 TWO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE, PRIOR TO O'HARE, I APPLAUD 
00:09:43 NAPOLITANO FOR STANDING UP. 
00:09:45 IN JULY HE WAS PASTOR VIOLATED THE LAW. 
00:09:49 I APPRECIATE IF YOU PAID ATTENTION, I WAITED FOUR HOURS TO BE HEARD. 
00:09:54 IT'S DISRESPECTFUL WHEN YOU'RE HAVING YOUR PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS. 
00:10:00 I GUESS NOT, MR. MAYOR YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP TALKING? 
00:10:03 THAT'S OKAY. 
00:10:07 JUST KEEP TALKING, THAT'S REALLY NICE. 
00:10:09 GOOD THING YOU'RE GOING. 
00:10:13 ACCOUNTABILITY WOULD BE NICE. 
00:10:15 SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON NEEDS TO BE RELIEVED OF HIS POWERS. 
00:10:18 HE BROKE THE LAW, PLAIN AND SIMPLE AS DID THE 8th DISTRICT WHO 
00:10:25 SCRUBBED THE POLICE REPORT THAT WAS DOCUMENTED THE VIOLATION OF LAW. 
00:10:29 HE SHOULD BE RELEASED TOO. 
00:10:31 BUT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING. 
00:10:32 BECAUSE NOBODY SEEMS TO GIVE A DAM. 
00:10:34 YOU GUYS WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS TEXT FOR NICOTINE, AS VAPING IS THE 
00:10:40 BIGGEST THING GOING ON IN CPS. 
00:10:43 I WORKED FOUR YEARS IN CPS BEFORE I WAS REMOVED OVER SOME NONSENSE 
00:10:49 AND IT'S NOT, IT'S WE'D. 
00:10:52 BUT THIS BODY DECRIMINALIZED SIX YEARS AGO. 
00:10:56 IT'S A GRAB FOR MONEY AND MORE TAX REVENUE. 
00:11:00 THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW HOW TO DO. 
00:11:01 IT'S GRAB MONEY AND WASTE IT ON OTHER THINGS. 
00:11:05 IF YOU GAVE A DAM ABOUT THE TAONZ, WOULD YOU NEVER HAVE 
00:11:11 DECRIMINALIZED MARIJUANA IN THE FIRST PLACE. 
00:11:13 KIDS ARE JUST GETTING VAPED ALL DAY LONG AND THAT'S ALL THEY CARE 
00:11:15 ABOUT. 
00:11:16 THANK YOU. 
00:11:20 OH AND BY THE WAI, MAYBE YOU NEED TO NEGOTIATE A POLICE CONTRACT 
00:11:27 BEFORE YOU LEAVE OFFICE, YOU COULD DO SOMETHING RIGHT BEFORE YOU 
00:11:29 LEAVE. 
00:11:31 >> THANK YOU, THE NEXT SFAEKER IS CHRISTINE CANO. 
00:11:47 >> GOOD MOANSINGER MEMBERS OF CITY COUNCIL. 
00:11:51 I'M CHRISTINE CANO'S AND I'M APPEARING BEFORE THE LINE OF ANIMALS, 
00:11:58 ORDINANCE, AMENDMENT OF MUNICIPAL THE 108330. 
00:12:02 ON GAUGER LICENSES. 
00:12:04 IT WAS INTRODUCED INTRODUCED BY ALDERMAN RYLEE AND NOW CLOSE SPONSOR 
00:12:15 BY HOPKINS, LOPEZ, I AM RECOGNIZE THE PEOPLE FOR AP MALLS. 
00:12:23 LAST WEEK AT THE COMMITTEE OF CONSUMER AND PROTECTION MEETING, DOZEN 
00:12:27 OF CITIZENS WERE HEARD. 
00:12:30 THOSE SUPPORTING AND THOSE OPPOSING THE ORDINANCE. 
00:12:33 AS I SAT THROUGH THE MEETINGS, ONE THING WAS CLEAR, BOTH SIDES WERE 
00:12:36 PASSIONATE. 
00:12:39 HOWEVER THE FACT IS, 334 VIOLATIONS WERE ISSUED AGAINST THE HORSE 
00:12:45 CARRIAGE COMPANIES. 
00:12:48 CHICAGO FINES FOR ANIMALS HAS BEEN APPEARING PEACEFULLY TO ENFORCE 
00:12:52 THE LAWS OF THE CITY FOR THE LAST YEAR. 
00:12:56 CONVERSELY, THOSE O POTION THE BAN SHOWED UP LAST WEEK, CONTINUOUSLY 
00:13:00 DIS CORRUPTING WHEN MEMBERS SUPPORTING THE BAN SPOKE IN VIOLATION OF 
00:13:04 THE OPEN MEETING AND AFTER THE MATTER WAS NOT BROUGHT TO A VOTE, ONE 
00:13:07 OF THE LEAD PEOPLE OF THEIR GROUP, POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA, PUBLICLY, 
00:13:15 WE WON AND PROCEEDED TO POST PHOTOS OF THE ALDERMAN AND THOSE IN 
00:13:21 SUPPORT OF THE BAN. 
00:13:24 CITY COUNCIL, WE RESPECT THE RULES. 
00:13:25 WE FOLLOW THEM. 
00:13:26 WE HAVE FAITH IN YOUR PROCESS. 
00:13:28 WE ASK THAT YOU NOT ALLOW THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE A MOCKERY OF THE 
00:13:34 PROCEDURES AND BULLY THE COMMITTEE INTO THIS ORDINANCE. 
00:13:38 AS BREAKING RULES NEED CONSEQUENCES. 
00:13:39 THANK YOU. 
00:13:40 >> THANK YOU. 
00:13:42 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS DIANE ARP. 
00:13:54 >> MY NAME IS DIANE HARP AND I'M SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF THE BAN OF 
00:13:58 HORSE CARRIAGES. 
00:14:00 I SPEAK LAST WEEK BEFORE A COMMITTEE AS WELL. 
00:14:04 AND THERE WAS SOME INTERESTING MADE BY THE OWNERS SOME OF WHICH I 
00:14:07 WILL ADDRESS HERE. 
00:14:09 DEALING WITH EMOTIONAL ISSUES LIKE ANIMAL ABUSE AND ANIMAL CRUELTY IS 
00:14:14 TOUGH BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DEAL WITH THE FACT. 
00:14:20 HORSE DRAWN OWNERS WERE FIND 334 AND INCURRED MORE THAN $25,000 IN 
00:14:24 FINES. 
00:14:26 THAER RACKING UP VIOLATION SXZ FINES FOR 2018 AS WELL. 
00:14:30 BE FLEAS THEY'RE BREAKING THE LAW. 
00:14:32 AND THEY'RE DOING IT REPEATEDLY. 
00:14:36 IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ANIMAL WELFARE ADVOCATES MONITOR HORSE 
00:14:45 CARRIAGE OWNERS 20% FLT THAT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE NO GUIDANCE IN PLACE 
00:14:49 TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T BREAK LAW. 
00:14:52 IF THEY BROKE THE LAW WITH 334 WITH ANIMAL ACTIVIST DOCUMENTING THEM, 
00:15:00 IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT THE ACTUAL NUMBER IS MAYBE TWICE OF WHAT IS 
00:15:03 REPORTED. 
00:15:05 THE LAWS WERE DRAFTED BY VETERINARIANS AND HORSE EXPERTS AND THEY 
00:15:09 WORKED HARD TO WRITE THESE LAWS. 
00:15:13 THE CARRIAGE DRIVERS AND THE OWNERS ARE MAKING A MOCKERY OF THE LAWS 
00:15:17 AND THIS GOVERNMENT. 
00:15:20 THEY'RE DISRESPECT THE GOVERNMENT AND POINTING THEIR KNOWSES AT YOU 
00:15:22 BECAUSE THEY CAN. 
00:15:25 WE'RE A NATION OF LAWS, LAWS THAT ARE TO BE FOLLOWED. 
00:15:29 YOU DON'T JUST GET TO FOLLOW THE LAWS THAT YOU AGREE WITH. 
00:15:33 CARRIAGE DRIVERS MAKE COMMENT BUZZ LOSING THEIR JOBS WHEN THIS BAN IS 
00:15:35 PASSED. 
00:15:39 IN DEED.COM ONE OF THE TOP JOB WEBSITES IN THE COUNTRY AS OF TODAY, 
00:15:47 HAS 5 2000 JOBS OPEN IN CHICAGO ALONE. 
00:15:50 JOBS THAT DON'T PROFIT FROM ANIMAL ABUSE AND ANIMAL CRUELTY. 
00:15:55 I GUESS TO SAY THAT 30 OR 40 OF THOSE HORSE CARRIAGE DRIVERS CAN FIND 
00:16:00 A JOB EASILY. 
00:16:03 IF I HAD EMPLOYEES THAT REPEATEDLY BROKE THE LAW, THEY SHOULD EXPECT 
00:16:09 TO LOSE THEIR JOB AND GET FIRED. 
00:16:11 THEY WOULD SAY IT'S OKAY TO HAVE HORSES WALKED 12 HOURS A DAY. 
00:16:18 LOOK AT SLAVERY, LOTS OF REASONS WERE GIVEN TO JUSTIFY WHITE PEOPLE 
00:16:23 OWNING BLACK PEOPLE. 
00:16:26 HISTORY HAS NOT BEEN LABORING AND WILL NOT BE FIND TO ANIMAL CRUELTY. 
00:16:31 CARRIAGE DRIVERS AND OWNERS WILL TELL YOU IT'S FINE TO HAVE A HORSE 
00:16:39 ON CONCRETE, INHALING THE FUMES. 
00:16:41 LOOK AT THE HORSE FARMS IN KENTUCKY, ARE THEY ON CONCRETE AND ASPHALT? 
00:16:45 NO. 
00:16:47 THEY'RE IN THE PLAINS ARE THEY RUNNING ON ASPHALT OR CONCRETE? 
00:16:52 I URGE YOU NOT TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND NOT RENEW THE LICENSES. 
00:16:58 >> THANK YOU. 
00:17:02 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS PAULA. 
00:17:07 >> GOOD MORNING. 
00:17:09 MY NAME IS PAULA AND I TOO AM WITH CHICAGO ALLIANCE FOR ANIMALS. 
00:17:15 THIS PAST SATURDAY THE 15th, I SPENT THE DAY ABSORBING THE HORSE 
00:17:18 DRAWN CARRIAGES. 
00:17:20 I WATCHED THEM PASS ME ON NORTH CLAY BORN AVENUE ON THEIR WAY TO 
00:17:24 WATER TOWER PLACE. 
00:17:27 A COURAGE PASSED ME AT 10:15 AM, 11:15 AM AND 1:45 P.M. 
00:17:35 LATER THAT DAY I HEADED DOWN TO WATER TOWER PLACE AND WHEN I LEFT 
00:17:40 DOWNTOWN AT 8:30 P.M. ALL OF THOSE HORSES WERE STILL WORKING. 
00:17:45 THAT'S TEN HOURS FOR THE FIRST HORSE. 
00:17:47 NINE HOURS FOR THE SECOND AND SEVEN FOR THE THIRD AND THEY WERE STILL 
00:17:51 WORKING. 
00:17:52 I DON'T KNOW WHAT TIME THE HORSES GOT TO HEAD BACK TO THEIR PENS AND 
00:17:56 TAKE A BREAK. 
00:17:58 I FILED A POLICE REPORT AND I SHARED ALL OF MY DOCUMENTATION WITH THE 
00:18:03 ACP. 
00:18:06 I WITNESSED OTHER VIOLATIONS INCLUDING GOING DOWN A RESTRICTED STREET. 
00:18:11 I HAVE AUTONOMY. 
00:18:12 I GOT TO LEAVE WHEN I WAS TIRED. 
00:18:15 I HAVE THE FREEDOM TO GRAB A BEVERAGE AND WALK WHERE I WANT TO WALK 
00:18:21 WHEN I WANT TO TO TURN TO LOOK TO TALK WHEN I WANT TO. 
00:18:26 AUTONOMY. 
00:18:29 THESE WORKHORSES DON'T HAVE ANY AUTONOMY. 
00:18:33 THEY DON'T HAVE THE FREEDOM TO PROVIDE THEMSELVES TO PROVIDE 
00:18:37 THEMSELVES WITH COMFORT. 
00:18:39 I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL AND THANK YOU 
00:18:43 ALDERMAN AND THANK YOU TO THE OVER 20 VERBAL TESTIMONIES GIVEN LAST 
00:18:50 WEDNESDAY THE 12 IN FAVOR OF A HORSE CARRIAGE BAN. 
00:18:54 PLEASE LET'S GET A VOTE ON THE BILL. 
00:18:57 LET'S DO THE HUMANE THING AND END THE HORSE CARRIAGES IN CHICAGO. 
00:18:59 THANK YOU. 
00:19:01 >> THANK YOU. 
00:19:04 >> NEXT SPEAKER IS MARLA ROSE. 
00:19:08 >> GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU. 
00:19:11 I JUST WANTED TO READ A LETTER THAT WAS SENT TO US FROM CHARLIE LUKE 
00:19:17 OF SALT LAKE CITY WHICH RECENTLY BAND THE HORSE CARRIAGE TRADE FROM 
00:19:21 THE STAOE. I ALSO WANT TO QUICKLY SAY, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE NOT HAD A 
00:19:34 MAJOR CATASTROPHE YET, BUT IF SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN, THE BLOOD IS ON 
00:19:39 OUR HANDS FOR BANNING THIS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. 
00:19:42 THIS IS WHAT HE TWRO. DEAR ALDERMAN ON THE CHICAGO CITY COUNSEL SI. I 
00:19:46 HAVE SERVED IN THE SALT LAKE CITY COUNCIL FOR MORE THAN SIX YEARS. 
00:19:50 DURING THAT TIME I PROUD SPEAR HEADED THE EFFORT TO SUCCESSFULLY END 
00:19:55 THE USE OF HORSE DRAWN CARRIAGES ON SALT LAKE CITY STREETS. 
00:20:01 AMONG MANY HARD CALLS DURING THESE ALMOST 7 YEARS, ENDING THE HORSE 
00:20:07 DRAWN CARRIAGE WAS A NECESSARY TASK I TOOK ON WITHOUT HESITATION. 
00:20:11 AFTER MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL CAREFULLY STUDIED THE FACTS AND 
00:20:18 CITY RESIDENTS WAITED, THE COUNCIL SPOKE IN A UNANIMOUS WAY THAT 
00:20:22 BANNED THE ARCHAIC PRACTICE. 
00:20:24 I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN WHY WE PURSUED THIS COURSE OF ABDOMINALING 
00:20:34 AND SUPPORT ALDERMAN RYLEE'S HUMANE BAN. 
00:20:39 IT CAME ON THE HEELS OF INCIDENT INVOLVING A HORSE NAMED JERAGE WHO 
00:20:47 WAS PULLING A CARRIAGE IN A 90 DEGREE HEAT. 
00:20:52 TRAVELING PHOTOS WERE WIDELY CIRCULATED. 
00:20:58 THE CARRIAGE COMPANY DISCLOSED THE TRUTH THE HORSE DIED THAT DAY. 
00:21:04 HIS SPAKT CAUSE OF DEATH REMAIN UNCLEAR. 
00:21:07 PRIOR TO PASSION THE BAN, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE SALT LAKE AREA HAD 
00:21:13 ORDINANCES AIMED AT REGULATING THE HORSE MARRIAGE INDUSTRY AND MAKING 
00:21:18 THE PRACTICE LESS CRUEL. 
00:21:21 HOWEVER, THESE REGULATIONS PROVED DOULT MONITOR AND ENFORCE. 
00:21:28 LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OFFICERS ARE BUSY AND PRESSED WITH OTHER URGENT 
00:21:31 SWAYSSING. 
00:21:34 PRIOR ENFORCEMENT AIMED AT THIS INDUSTRY MAY HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO 
00:21:38 JUSTIFY AND MAINTAIN BASED ON EXISTING LAWS. 
00:21:41 I UNDERSTAND CHICAGO'S CONSIDERING A BAN ON HORSE CARRIAGES. 
00:21:46 THE NEWS REPORT INDICATE YOUR CITY FACES SIMILAR DILEMMAS AND ISSUES 
00:21:51 WITH HORSE DRAWN CARRIAGES THAT WE DID. 
00:21:53 I BELIEVE OUR BAN HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE CHICAGO 
00:21:59 TO PURSUE A SIMILAR PAFMGT GETTING CARRIAGES IMPROVE TRAFFIC FLOW AND 
00:22:04 TRAFFIC SAFETY. 
00:22:06 I'M PROUD OF SALT LAKE CITY BEING ABLE TO PROVE ITSELF A LEADER. 
00:22:12 THANK YOU. 
00:22:14 >> THANK YOU, THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JODI. 
00:22:21 >> GOOD MOANSINGER MAYOR EMANUEL AND CITY COUNCIL. 
00:22:26 YOU KNOW THE SAYING, SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING? 
00:22:30 WELL MYSELF AND MEMBERS OF CAA HAVE WITNESSED AND DOCUMENTED HORSES 
00:22:35 BEING OVERWORKED, HORSES NOT PROVIDE WATER AND WORKED WHEN IT'S 90 
00:22:40 OR HOTTER. 
00:22:43 WE ALSO WITNESSED NUMEROUS PUBLIC VIOLATIONS. 
00:22:46 SO WE HAVE SAID SOMETHING BECAUSE OF OUR DAYTIME STAMP PHOTOS WE 
00:22:50 SUBMITTED TO THE CITY OFFICE OF BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND CONSUMER 
00:22:52 PROTECTION. 
00:22:55 THE CITY HAS SITED CARRIAGE COMPANIES FOR 334 VIOLATION SXZ FIND THEM 
00:23:05 $25,000 FOR 2017 ALONE WE'RE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT 2018. 
00:23:08 THAT'S A LOT OF VIOLATIONS BUT IT'S A FRACTION OF WHAT WE WITNESSED 
00:23:13 DOCUMENTED AND SUBMITTED TO THE CITY. 
00:23:16 I I SPENT SIX LONG DAYS LAST YEAR DOCUMENTING VIOLATIONS AND I 
00:23:21 COUNTED AT LEAST 100. 
00:23:25 YET BACP DID NOT FINE OR SITE ANY COMPANIES OR DRIVERS ON THOSE DATES 
00:23:31 DESPITE WEALTH OF EVIDENCE THAT IDENTIFY THE DRIVERS AND THE CARRIAGE 
00:23:33 NUMBERS. 
00:23:37 BACP RESPONSE WAS WE ARE ENABLE TO DETERMINE WHO THE HORSE CARRIAGE 
00:23:44 OPERATOR WAS, MAKE ITING SEEM LIKE IT WAS ONE VIOLATION REPORTED. 
00:23:48 THIS IS FROM THE REPORT I SITED CARRIAGE NUMBER 6 ARRIVED AT 11:15 
00:23:55 AND STILL ON THE STREET AFTER 11:00 P.M., THAT'S 12 HOURS. 
00:24:02 12 HOURS AGAIN. 
00:24:04 CHICAGO HORSE AND CARRIAGE NUMBER 15, ARRIVED AT 12:25 AND STILL ON 
00:24:10 THE STREET ON THE STREET AFTER 10:23, THAT'S TEN HOURS. 
00:24:16 CARRIAGE 17, ARRIVED BY 5:35 AND STILL ON THE STREET AFTER 10:21, TEN 
00:24:21 HOURS. 
00:24:24 STILL ON THE STREET AT 10:48, TEN HOURS. 
00:24:28 THIS DOES NOT EVEN TAKE INTO ACTION THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES THE 
00:24:33 HORSE TO GET FROM THE STABLE TO THE CARRIAGE STAND WHICH IS ABOUT A 
00:24:39 ONE-HOUR TRIP. 
00:24:41 I COUNTED AT LEAST 9 VIOLATIONS THAT DAY.

00:24:49 PROTECTION. 
00:24:53 LASTLY, I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO ALDERMEN AND CITY COUNCIL THAT WE 
00:25:01 CAN CARE ABOUT HUMANS AND HORSES AT THE SAME TIME. 
00:25:04 JUST BECAUSE WE CARE ABOUT HORSES, DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE DON'T CARE 
00:25:10 ABOUT HUMANS. 
00:25:14 ALDERMAN MITT PLEASE PUT THIS ON A MEASURE SINCE IT'S BEEN ON THE 
00:25:19 COMMITTEE SINCE DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR. 
00:25:20 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:25:34 >> GOOD MORNING, CITY COUNCIL AND GOOD MORNING MR. MAYOR.

00:25:42 I BELIEVE THAT YOU STILL HAVE SOME FIGHT IN YOU AND YOU STILL HAVE 
00:25:46 GOD'S WORK TO DO. 
00:25:49 I BELIEVE YOU STILL CAN DO GOD'S WORK. 
00:25:54 I'M INVITING TO HEAR WHAT THE PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY. 
00:25:57 I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE, A MAN WHO STILL HAS A MISSION TO FULFILL AND 
00:26:03 YOU HAVE YET TO REALLY TAP INTO THAT MISSION. 
00:26:06 AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD COME AND COME OUT INTO THE COMMUNITIES 
00:26:13 AND STILL HEAR WHAT THE COMMUNITIES HAVE TO SAY. 
00:26:16 THEY MAY 'CAUSE AND THEY MAY FUSS, BUT THEY ARE CUSSING AND FUSSING 
00:26:24 BECAUSE THEY'RE HURTING. 
00:26:25 AND I THINK THAT YOU'RE MISSION IS NOT DONE YET. 
00:26:28 AND EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT THE MAYOR, YOU STILL HAVE WORK TO DO SOME 
00:26:34 VALUABLE WORK TO DO. 
00:26:37 AND YOU SHOULD STILL FULFILL PURSUE THAT ENDEAVOUR. 
00:26:42 TO THE CITY COUNCIL I SAY THANK YOU FOR PASSION AN ORDINANCE THAT YOU 
00:26:49 PASSED ON ACCOUNTABILITY OF MONEY. 
00:26:52 I SPOKE ON ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE CITY COUNCIL PASSED AN ORDINANCE 
00:26:58 WHERE $15 MILLION EXPENDITURES HAVE TO COME BEFORE THE COUNCIL. 
00:27:01 I BELIEVE THAT'S A GOOD STEP TOWARDS ACCOUNTABILITY AND ECONOMIC 
00:27:07 FEASIBILITY AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT. 
00:27:10 AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE COST VALUE OF THESE 
00:27:15 BLUE LIGHT CAMERAS. 
00:27:21 I THINK THAT YOU--WE DON'T GET ENOUGH ECONOMIC IMPACT FOR THE CAMERAS. 
00:27:25 THEY'RE IN A LOT OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. 
00:27:28 YET A LOT OF CRIME AND VIOLENCE ARE GOING ON. 
00:27:32 YOU NEVER HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE BEING CAUGHT BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF CAMERAS. 
00:27:38 WHY AREN'T THESE CAMERAS CAPTURING ALL OF THIS VIOLENCE GOING ON? 
00:27:47 THEY CREATE A NEGATIVE IMPACT. 
00:27:49 WHEN PEOPLE SEE THE CAMERAS THEY LOOK AT THE AREA AS A HIGH-CRIME 
00:27:53 AREA. 
00:27:54 YET CRIME IS NOT BEING I AM PAKTD BY THESE CAMERAS. 
00:27:59 WE NEED TO LOOK MORE ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT THESE BLUE LIGHT 
00:28:05 CAMERAS ARE HAVING ON OUR COMMUNITY. 
00:28:08 I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SPEAK TO AN ORDINANCE THAT I HEARD THAT IS BEING 
00:28:15 PASSED THAT WANTS TO THAT WANTS TO DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE 
00:28:21 HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. 
00:28:23 NOW, THIS ORDINANCE WANTS TO DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE 
00:28:28 HOUSING IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SUPPOSEDLY OVERLY BURDENED. 
00:28:33 NOW WE HAVE AREAS ON THE NORTH SIDE THAT DON'T WANT AFFORDABLE 
00:28:36 HOUSING. 
00:28:37 >> THANK YOU. 
00:28:40 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS PASTOR DEMYTRIS CRAWFORD.

00:29:23 -1 00 DEGREES. 
00:29:28 HE WAS IN A NURSING HOME. 
00:29:33 HIS CLAIM WAS DENIED. 
00:29:34 THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HIM. 
00:29:37 WE'RE 14 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO, WE HAVE 50 ALDERMAN, 
00:29:44 AND SPACE CONSTITUTION. 
00:29:45 AND WE HAVE THE WORD OF GOD. 
00:29:49 THESE FINANCIAL CRIMES I'VE ALREADY WENT TO THE ALDERMAN, ALDERMAN

00:31:05 COMMUNITIES ARE RIGHT OR WRONG? 
00:31:07 THAT'S THE REASON THAT I ASK GOD, IF YOU DON'T STAY, ALLOW ME TO BE 
00:31:12 THE MAYOR. 
00:31:14 THIS MAN HAS DONE WHAT HE COULD IN HIS TERM. 
00:31:16 AND HE WAS A GOOD MAN. 
00:31:18 BUT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING, WE HAVE TO STOP THIS FOOLISHNESS, GO 
00:31:23 BACK TO THE WORD OF GOD WHEN WE SHOULD BE, AND ASK GOD TO STEP IN. 
00:31:27 AND THAT'S WHY THE CONSTITUTION CAME FROM. 
00:31:29 IT DIDN'T COME FROM US. 
00:31:32 IT CAME FROM MANY MEN AND WOMEN THAT WERE GOING TO ORDINANCE AND

00:35:06 THE BUILDING FAILTD 2018 BUILDING CODES AND IT HAS A LOT OF PAST 
00:35:09 BUILDING CODES. 
00:35:11 I RECORDED THIS TO THE ALDERMAN. 
00:35:13 I WENT TO THE BUILDING ZONING COMMITTEE. 
00:35:15 THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. 
00:35:16 I ALSO GAVE YOU A COPY OF PICTURES, I GAVE YOU A U.S. B OF THE LEAKS

00:35:57 I KNOW YOU PASSED A ORDINANCE THAT A BUILDING SHOULD BE CHECKED EVERY 
00:36:00 YEAR OR MORE THAN EVERY YEAR BECAUSE IT'S ONLY CHECKED ONE TIME, ONCE 
00:36:04 A YEAR.

00:36:52 NOTICE SO I CAN MOVE FORWARD. 
00:36:53 THANK YOU. 
00:36:54 >> THANK YOU. 
00:36:55 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS DONALD. 
00:37:19 >> GOOD MORNING MR. MAYOR, COUNCILMEMBERS, THANK YOU FOR GIVING US 
00:37:22 THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. 
00:37:28 SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CARRIAGE HORSES OF CHICAGO. 
00:37:34 I'M THE OLDEST CARRIAGE DRIVER IN CHICK KHIFJT WHEN I RETIRED FROM 
00:37:40 I.B.M., I BECAME A CARRIAGE DRIVER BAYS LOVE THE HORSES. 
00:37:45 AND I'VE DRIVEN OVER 165 HORSES, TRAINED OVER 150 STUDENTS TO DRIVE 
00:37:50 CARRIAGES, I THINK I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HORSES. 
00:37:53 I PURCHASED AND RETIRED AND RESTORED TWO CARRIAGE HORSES FROM THE 
00:37:58 ORIGINAL COMPANY, I STILL HAVE ONE TODAY AND I PAY ALL THOSE EXPENSES 
00:38:03 FROM THE MONEY I MAKE, IT COST ME ABOUT $20,000 AND MY GIRL IS 20 
00:38:15 YEARS OLD AND WEIGH 2700. 
00:38:16 SHE IS PART OF THE POLO CLUB. 
00:38:19 AND I WILL TELL YOU, THERE IS NO ABUSE. 
00:38:23 THE HORSES GET WATER. 
00:38:26 AT THE STAND, WE BRING WATER OUT IN THE WINTER TIME. 
00:38:30 WE EACH CARRY ONE TO THREE GALLONS OF WATER ON THE CARRIAGE. 
00:38:35 THERE IS NO DOCUMENTATION WHATSOEVER OF A HORSE NOT GETTING WATER. 
00:38:40 IF THEY DID NOT GET WATER, THEY WOULD THEY WOULD DIE. 
00:38:44 YOU DON'T SEE ANY DEAD HORSES IN CHICAGO. 
00:38:47 NOW THE PROBLEM IS, EVERYBODY SAYS THEY LOVE HORSES. 
00:38:50 BUT JUST BECAUSE YOU LOVE HORSES DOES NOT GIVE YOU SCIENTIFIC 
00:38:53 EVIDENCE. 
00:38:55 I HAVE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IN A PACKAGE, 
00:39:00 FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS A STUDY FROM A VETERINARIAN FROM CALIFORNIA 
00:39:04 THAT WENT TO NEW YORK AND DID TWO KINDS OF CHEMICAL TESTS ON THE 
00:39:11 HORSES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHIFT AND OTHER END, AND COMPARED THAT 
00:39:14 TO OTHER HORSES ON THE FIELD THAT WERE NOT WORKING. 
00:39:18 THE EFFECT WAS THE SAME, THERE WAS NO DAMAGE. 
00:39:20 NOW A HORSE IS ONLY WORKING WHEN ITS PULLING. 
00:39:26 MIND YOU THESE HORSES WERE DESIGNED TO BE WAR HORSES CARRYING 
00:39:33 THOUSANDS OF POUNDS. 
00:39:36 SO THE HORSES ONLY WORKING WHEN IT'S PULLING, WHEN IT'S STANDING, 
00:39:41 RESTING AS REQUIRED, 15 MINUTES AT THE STAND IS NOT WORKING WH. IT'S 
00:39:46 IN TRAFFIC AND STOPPED IT'S NOT WORKING. 
00:39:48 WHEN IT'S A STOP SIGN, IT'S NOT WORKING. 
00:39:52 SOL IT WORKS 60% OF THE RIDE AND OUT OF 6 HOURS, 2.6 HOURS. 
00:39:59 THE LAW NEEDS TO BE REVISITED. 
00:40:00 THERE IS ANOTHER POINT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AND THAT IS, WHEN THE 
00:40:07 TICKETS WERE ISSUED, VACP IS REQUIRED TO ISSUE A TICKET ON COMPLAINT. 
00:40:12 THERE IS BEEN NO FACTUAL ADMISSION TO A TICKET, ONLY A PLEA. 
00:40:19 SO IT'S ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT THAT THERE ARE 334 VIOLATIONS. 
00:40:24 >> THANK YOU EVERYONE, THE TIME ALLOTTED FOR PUBLIC COMMENT HAS 
00:40:28 EXPIRED. 
00:40:31 >> END OF PUBLIC COMMENT. 
00:40:37 CHAIR RECOGNIZES ALDERMAN BURKE RESOLUTIONS, SORRY, RESOLUTIONS, MA

00:41:41 THAT COULD REACH THE PERSON. 
00:41:42 AND WHERE KNOWING THAT HE WAS ALL STOOD BETWEEN THE YOUNG LADY AND A 
00:41:49 DEATH, WITHOUT A THOUGHT OF HIS OWN SAFE REMOVED HIS EQUIPMENT AND

00:44:35 RESPONDED WITH INTELLIGENCE AND INSTANT TO SAVE THESE PEOPLE WITH NO

00:44:43 ALTHOUGH POLICE AND FIRE HELICOPTERS AND BOATS HAD BEEN DEPLOYED THIS 
00:44:49 OFFICER QUICKLY ASSESSED THE SITUATION AND REALIZED THAT HE ALONE, HE 
00:44:56 ALONE STOOD POSSIBLY THE ONLY CHANCE THAT YOUNG 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL HAD

01:20:56 I'VE SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES, MEN AND WOMEN THAT SPEAK FIVE LANGUAGES 
01:20:57 AND 
01:21:05 THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD DEPORT THESE VETERANS, IS NOT ONLY WRONG BUT 
01:21:09 STUPID. 
01:21:12 THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN DEFENSE. 
01:21:15 OUR VETERANS RISK EVERYTHING TO DEFEND AMERICANS FROM TYRANNY AND 
01:21:21 OPPRESSION. 
01:21:25 --OPPRESSION. 
01:21:27 THESE ARE MEN AND WOMEN WITH DISCIPLINE AND DETERMINE NAIFMGTS THESE 
01:21:30 MEN AND WOMEN UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE ON A TEAM. 
01:21:34 THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TAKES TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY. 
01:21:37 I FEEL SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THE RESOLUTION BECAUSE DEPORTING VETERANS 
01:21:43 IS AN ATTACK IN OUR COUNTRY. 
01:21:48 THE PRESIDENT IS ATTACKING OUR VETERANS AND OUR COUNT RAOE. THIS IS 
01:21:51 NOT ONLY WRONG BUT IT'S STIPULATED. 
01:21:54 THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:21:56 >> ALDERMAN BURKE. 
01:21:58 >> NOBODY ELSE WISHES TO BE HEARD, YOUR HONOR, I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. 
01:22:05 YOUR HONOR, THIS LEGISLATION THAT ALDERMAN VILLEGAS REFERRED TO IS 
01:22:14 PENEDING IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. 
01:22:16 AND IT'S DESIGNED TO PRO TENTH MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND OUR 
01:22:22 NATION'S HONORED VETERAN BORN OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES FROM 
01:22:28 DEPORTATION AND TO FURTHER PERMIT CERTAIN DEPOETEDER VETERANS TO 
01:22:32 RETURN TO THIS COUNTRY. 
01:22:36 RESENT STATISTIC SHOW THAT MORE THAN 65,000 IMMIGRANTS CURRENTLY 
01:22:44 SERVE IN THE ARMED FORCES OF OUR NATION. 
01:22:47 5% ARE FOREIGN BORN. 
01:22:50 AT LEAST 10,000 RECRUITS ENLISTED THROUGH THE MILITARY A SESSIONS 
01:22:57 VITAL TO THE NATIONAL INTEREST, MAN BY PROGRAM OFFERED EXPEDITED 
01:23:06 CITIZENSHIP IN RETURN FOR THEIR SKILL SETS IMPORTANT TO THE ARMED 
01:23:09 FORCES. 
01:23:12 SOME OF THESE VETERANS WERE INFORMED THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE SOME FAMILY 
01:23:25 MEMBERS LIVE ABROAD THEY WERE DEEMED TO BE AT RISK. 
01:23:28 AND THE PENTAGON SUSPEND THE PROGRAM IN 2016 AND SINCE THAT TIME HAS 
01:23:33 SUBJECTED MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM IN THE MAN VEE PROGRAM TO GO 
01:23:44 THROUGH INVESTIGATIONS THAT SEEM TO BE A PRETEXT FOR THEIR FORCABLE 
01:23:49 DISCHARGE FROM THE MILITARY. 
01:23:51 IN COURT FILESING A NUMBER OF THESE MEN AND WOMEN HAVE ARGUED THAT 
01:23:55 THEY WERE NOT PROVIDED WITH AN ADEQUATE EXPLANATION FOR THEIR 
01:24:03 DISMISSAL OTHER THAN A SUSPICION THAT A FAMILY MEMBER DEEMS THEM 
01:24:10 MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES TO BE A SECURITY RISK. 
01:24:14 THESE WOMEN AND MEN AS ALDERMAN VILLEGAS HAS POINTED OUT HAS HAVE 
01:24:26 SACRIFICED FOR OUR NATION. 
01:24:29 THNS A NEW STORY, EXPENDING BACK TO THE COLONIAL HE RA, IMMIGRANTS 
01:24:34 HAVE BEEN AT THE FRONT OF THE LINES IN BOTH WAR AND PEACE. 
01:24:38 THEY DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM AND THE PROTECTION 
01:24:41 OF OUR CITIZENS. 
01:24:45 IS IT NOT SIMPLY FAIR THAT THEIR SERVICE SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND AN 
01:24:53 ASSURANCE GRANTED THAT HAVING BROKEN NO LAWS, THESE VETERANS HAVE 
01:24:58 BEEN AFFORDED PROTECTION AND ALLOWED TO RETURN TO THIS NATION WITH 
01:25:03 FULL LEGAL STATUS. 
01:25:11 BY THE SAME TOKEN THEY CALL TO HOMELAND SECURITY TO HAVE THESE 
01:25:19 SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN REMOVED FROM THESE SHOESER AND BE PERMITTED TO 
01:25:24 BE ALLOWED BACK AS IMMIGRANT WITH FULL RIGHTS. 
01:25:30 JUSTICE AND HUMANITY SIMPLY CRY OUT FOR IMMIGRATION EFFECTED BY OF 
01:25:36 THE VETERANS IN FORM OF LEGISLATIVE RELIEF OF THE VETERANS AND VISA 
01:25:43 PROTECTION ACT WHICH CHICAGO, A WELCOMING CITY SHOULD STRONGLY

01:26:54 THEY RECOMMEND THAT THESE APPOINTMENTS BE APPROVED. 
01:27:01 I MOVE THAT THEY BE APPLIED TO THE SAME ROLL CALL APPLIED TO THE ITEM

01:27:09 >> HEARING NO OBJECTION SO ORDERED. 
01:27:11 >> YOUR HONOR, ITEMS NUMBER 11, 12 AND 1 3, WILL BE PLACED IN FILE. 
01:27:23 NUMBER 14, TO BE ENTER AND EXECUTE A SETTLEMENT ORDER IN THE CASE OF 
01:27:30 LA TASHA JONES, AS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF BETTY JONES DECEASED. 
01:27:45 THERE MAY BE MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL THAT WISH TO ADDRESS THIS. I 
01:27:51 WOULD LIKE RESERVE MY RIGHT TO CLOSE. 
01:27:55 >> ALDERMAN BURKE? 
01:27:59 OH ALDERMAN IRVING. 
01:28:10 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:28:12 I'M GLAD THAT THIS MATTER HAS FINALLY BEEN RESOLVED. 
01:28:18 THE EVENTS OF DECEMBER NIGHT WILL FOREVER BE CEMENTED IN MY BRAIN TO 
01:28:24 SEE WHAT THE AFTERMATH HAS BEEN AND THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN. 
01:28:29 I HAVE HAPPY TO SEE THAT WE'RE MAKING A RIGHT CHANGE. 
01:28:42 WHILE THIS IS A HEFTY TIME FOR US TO PAY FOR THIS, IT CANNOT GO IN 
01:28:50 REPLACEMENT OF THE LIFE OF A MOTHER, A GRANDMOTHER WHO SIMPLY WAS 
01:28:55 TRYING TO HELP. 
01:28:58 AND SO, WHILE THIS SETTLEMENT CAN'T REPLACE HER, IT WILL HELP THAT 
01:29:02 FAMILY THAT HAS HAD SOME CHALLENGES MOVE FORWARD. 
01:29:07 I SPEAK WITH THEM PERIODICALLY, AS THEY'RE STILL RESIDENTS IN THE 
01:29:10 COMMUNITY. 
01:29:12 AND WE JUST HOPE THAT THIS HELPS CLOSE THAT CHAPTER AND ALLOW THIS 
01:29:16 FAMILY TO MOVE FORWARD IN A NICE AND PEACEFUL MANNER. 
01:29:20 THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:29:24 ?FM ALDERMAN BURKE? 
01:29:30 >> YOUR HONOR, AS ALDERMAN ERVIN POINTS OUT, THIS IS A TRAGIC CASE 
01:29:41 AND REGRETABLY, BETTY WAS JUST AT THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME. 
01:29:46 SHE WAS TRYING TO BE A GOOD NEIGHBOR AND UNDERSTAND WAS STANDING IN 
01:29:55 THE VICINITY OF THE PERSON WHO AFTER FIRED AT. 
01:30:05 REGRETABLY SOME OF THE BROWNS WENT THROUGH THE PERSON THE PERSON WAS 
01:30:14 AIMING AT AND STRUCK BETTY CAUSING HER DEATH. 
01:30:22 THERE REALLY WAS NO DEFENSE THAT THE CITY COULD INVOKE IN THIS CASE. 
01:30:31 AND THE INITIAL DEMAND WAS FOR 60 MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WAS THEN 
01:30:37 LOWERED TO 45 MILLION DOLLARS. 
01:30:41 BUT THE LAW DEPARTMENT TO THE BENEFIT OF THE TAXPAYERS WAS ABLE TO 
01:30:48 NEGOTIATE THAT DEMAND DOWN TO 16 MILLION DOLLARS INCLUDING ATTORNEY'S 
01:30:55 FEES AND COSTS. 
01:30:58 SO IT IS GOOD THAT THE FAMILY CAN NOW GET SOME CLOSURE ON THIS MATTER 
01:31:08 AND GO ON WITH THEIR LIVES. 
01:31:12 AS WE ADOPT THIS RESOLUTION, WE SHOULD ALSO PAY OUR RESPECTS TO BETTY 
01:31:23 AND TO EXPRESS OR CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY FOR THEIR LOSS. 
01:31:33 AND BE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT GOD HAS BETTY IN HIS HANDS. 
01:31:39 SHE WILL REST FOREVER IN HEAVEN.

01:38:42 ORDINANCE AUTHORIZING AN AMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 4-46 AND 47 OF 
01:38:49 MUNICIPAL CODE. 
01:38:51 MR. PRESIDENT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, WHO HAVE 
01:38:56 SERVED WITH ME IN THIS BODY, I'VE ADVOCATED FOR THE PASSAGE OF ANTI 
01:39:04 SMOKE ORDINANCES IN THIS COUNCIL FOR MORE THAN 35 YEARS. 
01:39:11 THERE IN DEED IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE GRAVE RISK THAT TOBACCO PRODUCTS 
01:39:22 COMPEL US TO REALIZE AS IN INJURIOUS ESPECIALLY AMONG THE MOST 
01:39:31 VULNERABLE OF OUR POPULATION, THE YOUTH OF OUR CITY. 
01:39:36 HISTORICALLY, CHICAGO HAS BEEN AT THE VANGUARD RECENTLY OF THE 
01:39:44 NATIONWIDE MOVEMENT TO REDUCE AND ELIMINATE TOBACCO CONSUMPTION. 
01:39:48 IT WAS BACK IN 1994 WHEN I FIRST INTRODUCED AN ORDINANCE TO BAN 
01:39:53 SMOKING IN THE WORK PLACE. 
01:39:54 BUT NOW WE NEED TO ADDRESS AN EVEN MORE INSIDOUS TOBACCO HEALTH 
01:40:01 THREAT. 
01:40:04 SINCE THEIR INTRODUCTION INTO THE MARKETPLACE IN 2007, E CIGARETTES 
01:40:12 HAVE BECOME THE MOST COMMONLY TOBACCO PRODUCT AMONG MIDDLE SCHOOL AND 
01:40:17 HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, HERE IN OUR NATION. 
01:40:20 AND THESE DEVICES WHICH NOW ARE BECOMING UBIQUITOUS ARE BEING USED BY 
01:40:33 KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL AT AN INCREASINGLY HAZARDOUS RATE. 
01:40:41 14.7 OF ALL CHICAGO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORT USING A TOBACCO 
01:40:49 PRODUCT AND 6.6 PERCENT OF THEM PURCHASE THESE ELECTRONIC VAPOR 
01:40:55 PRODUCTS THAT ARE INCLUSIVE OF E CIGARETTES WHICH IS ACCORDING TO 
01:41:01 DATA SUPPLIED BY HEALTHY CHICAGO. 
01:41:05 NOW, IF A YOUNGSTER IS BRINGING THIS INTO THE CLASSROOM, HOW DOES A 
01:41:12 TEACHER KNOW THAT IT'S NOT ONE OF THOSE DEVICES THAT YOU JUST PUT 
01:41:16 INTO A COMPUTER. 
01:41:18 BUT THIS IN DEED IS SOLD FOR ABOUT $50 WITH THESE CONTAINER TO 
01:41:29 INCLUDE THE VAPING PRODUCT. 
01:41:33 SOME OF THEM ARE QUITE UNASSUMING LIKE THIS LITTLE PRODUCT. 
01:41:40 I WOULDN'T KNOW THAT THIS IS A DEVICE DESIGNED TO PERMIT VAPING AND 
01:41:47 IT IS AND IT'S QUITE EXPENSIVE. 
01:41:50 THE SURGEON GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES HAS CALLED THIS A SERIOUS 
01:41:58 PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN AND SITED STATISTICS THAT SHOW A 900% INCREASE 
01:42:07 IN E CIGARETTE FROM HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM 2011 UNTIL 2015. 
01:42:15 AND IN 2017, 11.3% OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND 4 ABOUT THE 3% OF 
01:42:21 MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS WERE CONSUMING THESE VAPES FROM THESE PRODUCTS. 
01:42:25 SO THIS MOANSINGER THE MAYOR HAS TAKEN THE INITIATIVE AND INTRODUCING 
01:42:31 THIS ORDINANCE TO INCREASE THE TAX ON PURCHASE OF THESE DEVICES THAT 
01:42:41 VAPORIZE LIQUID NICOTINE FROM 80 CENTS TO $1.50 PLUS ADDITIONAL 
01:42:48 DOLLAR FOR FLUID OF THESE OTHER PRODUCTS THAT ARE ALSO BEING SOLD. 
01:42:57 AND I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT THIS IS DESIGNED TO BE ATTRACTING 
01:43:06 YOUNGSTERS. 
01:43:09 DONUT E JUICE IS WHAT THAT IS CALLED SO THE KIDS CAN USE IT. 
01:43:15 AND ACCORDING TO SOME OF THE TESTIMONY WE HEARD THIS MORNING, THE 
01:43:20 KIDS ARE BEING PRESSURED BY THEIR PEERS TO START VAPING. 
01:43:31 HOPEFULLY, THE INPOSITION OF THIS TAX IS ONE WAY TO DETER PRODUCTS BY 
01:43:40 YOUNGSTERS AND RESEARCH DATA SEEMS TO BEAR THAT OUT. 
01:43:45 YOU, I THINK WE'LL RECALL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BACK IN 2015, THE CITY 
01:43:52 COUNCIL PASSED A LIQUID NICOTINE ORDINANCE. 
01:43:58 BUT RECENTLY TOBACCO MANUFACTURES HAVE INTRODUCED THIS NEW PRODUCT 
01:44:00 INTO THE MARKET. 
01:44:03 AS I POINTED OUT, RESEMBLES THE ORDINARY FLASH DEVICE THAT CAN BE 
01:44:13 CHARGED ONCE IT'S INSERTED INTO A LAPTOP. 
01:44:17 THE NICOTINE PADS ARE WAIVERED, DISGUISING THE TRUE PURPOSE AND THESE 
01:44:28 E CIGARETTES ARE EASILY MISTAKEN BY PARENTS AND TEACHERS BY U.S. B 
01:44:33 DEVICES. 
01:44:36 THIS NICOTINE PRODUCTS DPUZ BECOME A GATEWAY TO TOBACCO USAGE AMONG 
01:44:44 HIGH SCHOOL AND MIDDLE SCHOOL USERS WHO BELIEVE THAT VAPING IS A SAFE 
01:44:51 ALTERNATIVE TO SMOKING. 
01:44:54 PROPOSITION 65 WARNS CONSUMERS THAT CHEMICALS CONTAINED IN E 
01:45:00 CIGARETTES MAY IN FACT CAUSE CANCER, BIRTH DEFECTS OR OTHER 
01:45:05 REPRODUCTIVE HARM. 
01:45:07 EVEN MORE ALARMING IS THE LACK OF REGULATION. 
01:45:10 THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRE E 
01:45:17 CIGARETTES MANUFACTURES TO APPLY FOR FDA REVIEW UNTIL THE SUMMER OF 
01:45:21 2022. 
01:45:22 WE SHOULD SHARE OF CONCERN OF PARENTS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THAT 
01:45:26 SOMETHING CLEARLY NEEDS TO BE DONE INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT FOR 
01:45:31 RETAILERS TO POSITION THESE PRODUCTS SAFELY BEHIND COUNTERS AND NOT 
01:45:36 AT THE POINT OF SALE AS DEFINED IN ARTICLE 5 SECTION 3-47020 OF THIS 
01:45:46 OPPOSED ORDINANCE WHICH WE ARE ASKING BE VOTED ON TODAY. 
01:45:52 THE ARD NANS REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT AND VITAL EXPENSE OF EARLIER 
01:45:58 ANTI-SMOKING MEASURES THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED INTO THE MUNICIPAL CODE 
01:46:03 OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES. 
01:46:05 I STRONGLY URGE ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE COUNCIL TO 
01:46:09 VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS PROPOSAL WHICH WAS RECOMMENDED ON THE COMMITTEE 
01:46:14 OF FFNLT UNLESS THERE IS OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR, I SUPPOSE WANTS ROLL 
01:46:18 CALL ON THIS? 
01:46:24 I MOVE THAT THE ORDINANCE OF THE ADOPTED BY ROLL CALL VOTE AND I

01:49:03 I'VE SEEN MY MOTHER STRUGGLE WITH SMOKING. 
01:49:06 I'M PROUD THAT THIS CITY COUNCIL THROUGH THE CITY OF ACTIONS BOTH ON 
01:49:11 PRICE AND ACCESS, WE NOW HAVE THE LOWEST TEEN SMOKING ON RECORD. 
01:49:17 WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT A TOBACCO-FREE GENERATION, AND THAT'S NOT NO 
01:49:22 LONGER ABOUT TALK WE'RE WITHIN EYESIGHT. 
01:49:25 I DO WANT TO KNOW WE'RE THE FIRST CITY COUNCIL AND CITY TO TAKE 
01:49:31 ACTION AGAINST E CIGARETTES. 
01:49:32 AND AT THAT TIME, WE DEBAITED SOME PEOPLE SAID SHOULD WAIT FOR THE 
01:49:36 FDA. 
01:49:38 WELL JUST THE OTHER DAY THE FDA ALERTED TO THE PROBLEM BUT A YEAR AND 
01:49:43 A HALF BEHIND THE PROBLEM. 
01:49:47 AND 90% OF SMOKERS START WHEN THEY'RE TEENS. 
01:49:50 E CIGARETTE UZ WERE MARKETING A A SENSATION DEVICE. 
01:49:55 IF YOU SAW WHAT ALDERMAN BURKE WAS HOLDING UP, THERE IS NOTHING IN 
01:50:01 THAT MARKETING ABOUT QUITTING, IT'S ABOUT ADDICTION, ALWAYS WAS ABOUT 
01:50:03 ADDICTION. 
01:50:04 IT WAS ANOTHER WAY TO GET AROUND THE FACT THAT ACCESS THE TOBACCO 
01:50:10 PRODUCT WERE MADE HARDER AND MORE EXPENSIVE. 
01:50:13 AND THE CITY COUNCIL IS GETTING AHEAD TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR KID'S 
01:50:17 HEALTH IS SECURE AND SAFE. 
01:50:19 I WOULD NOTE THAT ALL THE REVENUE WE RAISED FOR OUR PRICE ON SMOKE 
01:50:26 GOES TO PROVIDE 55,000 KIDS IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO, FREE EYE CARE AND 
01:50:31 FREE EYEGLASSES IF THEY NEED IT. 
01:50:34 THEY'RE ENSURING THEIR HEALTH. 
01:50:35 NOW I WANT TO BE CLEAR, IN THE 90s, THE TOBACCO COMPANIES WERE 
01:50:42 DISCOVERED TO HAVE LIED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHETHER THEY KNEW ALL 
01:50:46 ALONG THAT THEIR PRODUCT WERE ADDICTIVE. 
01:50:52 THEY MISLEAD, THEY LIED. 
01:50:55 NOW THEY CAME AROUND TO SELT SAME DEVICES WERE FOR QUITTING WHEN YOU 
01:51:00 DO NOT MARKET A PRODUCT ABOUT DONUTS AND OTHER PRODUCTS AS IF YOU'RE 
01:51:06 QUITTING, THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT QUITTING IN THOSE PRODUCTS. 
01:51:09 WHEN I WAS CHIEF OF STAFF OF PRESIDENT OBAMA, WE PASSED A LAW TO GIVE 
01:51:15 FDA THE AUTHORITY TO ACTUALLY GO AFTER TOBACCO COMPANIES AND PROHIBIT 
01:51:21 THE SALES OF TABACCO SALES TOWARDS YOUTH. 
01:51:25 AND MARK MY WORDS, IF THE FDA FIND THE TIME TO GO AFTER THE 
01:51:29 AUTHORITY, THEY'RE GOING TO USE THAT AUTHORITY THAT WAS PASSED IN 
01:51:33 JUNE OF 2009. 
01:51:35 I'M PROUD THAT THE CITY OF CHICAGO CONTINUES THE FOR FRONT OF OUR 
01:51:40 YOUTH AND KID'S HEALTH AND WE TAKE A STEP AHEAD OF EVERYBODY ELSE. 
01:51:44 NOT JUST AHEAD OF EVERYBODY ELSE BUT KNOWING FULL WELL THAT OUR FEES 
01:51:50 AND OUR REGULATIONS ARE ON TOBACCO PRODUCTS HAVE PREVENTED TEENS FROM 
01:51:55 EVER SMOKE ANDING WE'RE AHEAD OF THE SCHEDULE AND SEE A MOVE FOR 
01:51:58 THESE PRODUCTS. 
01:52:00 WE HAVE RAISED THE PRICE AND LIMIT THE ACCESS TO THESE PRODUCTS. 
01:52:04 I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COUNSEL SI. I KNOW WE MOVED 
01:52:07 WITH SPEED. 
01:52:08 THE PROCESS SOMETIMES DOES NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE. 
01:52:11 BUT IN ADDITION WHEN IT COMES TO SAVING LIVES, I WOULD SAY THE 
01:52:15 PROCESS IS NOW WORTH WHAT IT'S SUPPOSE TO BE. 
01:52:18 AND I IN THIS CASE, WANT TO THANK YOU FOR APPRECIATING MY DESIRE TO 
01:52:24 MOVE QUICKLY AND DO WHAT WE NEED TODAY DO TO STOP YOUTH BEING 
01:52:30 PRESSURED BY ANOTHER YOUTH TO HAVE ACCESS OR PURCHASE THAT PRODUCT 
01:52:34 WHICH BECOMES A LIFETIME OF SMOKING. 
01:52:36 ALL OF US KNOW SOMEBODY WHO IS ADDICTED TO NICOTINE, EVERYONE OF US. 
01:52:42 AND WE WATCH THEM STRUGGLE. 
01:52:45 AND MANY TIMES THOSE STRUGGLES BEGAN WHEN THEY WERE KIDS. 
01:52:50 I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR CONTINUOUS SUPPORT. 
01:52:55 I THINK IF THIS I'M NOT MISTAKEN THIS BRINGS US TO SIX TIMES THAT WE 
01:53:02 HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO PREVENT TEENS FROM SMOKE IN THE FIRST PLACE. 
01:53:07 WITH THAT, ALDERMAN AUSTIN, BUDGET.
