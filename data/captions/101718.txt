00:05:55 CALL A SPECIAL MEETING OF CHICAGO TO BE CONVENED AT 10 A.M. 
00:05:58 WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 17, 2018 IN THE COUNCIL CHAMBER IN CITY HALL 
00:06:03 FOR THE PURPOSE OF NO OTHER PURPOSE WHAT SO EVER. ONE, TO

00:06:11 2019 AND ENDING 2019 AND RELATED THERE TO AND TWO, TO RECEIVE 
00:06:17 THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT AND CONSIDER RESOLUTION 
00:06:24 FOR PUBLICATION AND SETTING DATE, TIME AND PLACE FOR THE 
00:06:30 EXECUTIVE BUDGET. RAHM EMANUEL, MAYOR. 
00:06:36 >> COMMUNICATIONS. 
00:06:39 >> COMMUNICATION FROM HIS HONOR THE MAYOR TO THE CITY COUNCIL 
00:06:42 CITY OF CHICAGO. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN TRANSMIT THE 2019 
00:06:48 BUDGET RECOMMENDATION AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT 
00:06:51 RECOMMENDATION. CONSIDER OF THE ITEMS IS APPRECIATED. 
00:06:57 REFERRED TO COMMITTEE AND GOVERNMENT BUDGET OPERATIONS. 
00:07:01 >> MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL, CHAIRMAN AUSTIN, CHAIRMAN BURKE AND 
00:07:10 FELLOW CHICAGO RESIDENTS, IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO PRESENT OUR 
00:07:14 2019 BUDGET PROPOSAL. THIS YEAR CHICAGO'S FISCAL AND ECONOMIC 
00:07:24 HEALTH IS STRONGER THEN IT HAS BEEN IN MANY YEARS. I LIKE YOU 
00:07:28 TO THINK OF WHERE WE WERE 7 SHORT YEARS AGO. ALL MOST TO THE 
00:07:32 DAY WHEN I GAVE MY FIRST BUDGET ADDRESS. THE CITY OF 
00:07:39 CHICAGO'S FISCAL HEALTH AND FISCAL CRISIS BREWING FOR YEARS 
00:07:43 HAD REACHED A BOILING POINT. WE FACED A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT OF 
00:07:47 $635 MILLION, 20 PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE BUDGET WAS IN THE RED. 
00:07:57 FOR EACH THE PREVIOUS THREE YEARS T THE CITY HAD TAKEN MORE 
00:08:02 THEN $300 MILLION OUT OF RESERVES JUST TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. 
00:08:08 ALL 4 CITY PENSION FUNDS WERE HURDLING TOWARDS INSOLVENCY. 
00:08:15 COMPANIES AND JOBS WERE LEAVING THE CITY. IN OCTOBER 2011, 7 
00:08:20 YEARS AGO, CHICAGO UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAD REACHED 11 PERCENT. 
00:08:26 MANY BELIEVED OUR BEST DAYS WERE BEHIND US. THAT ENERGY AND 
00:08:34 VIBRANCY THAT DEFINED CHICAGO FOR GENERATIONS WERE PART OF OUR 
00:08:39 PAST BUT NOT OUR FUTURE. SOME PREDICTED CHICAGO WILL BE THE 
00:08:44 NEXT DETROIT. OTHERS THOUGHT OUR BEST HOPE IS A HAIL MARY 
00:08:49 PASS. BUILD A CASINO, SCALE BACK GARBAGE PICK UP AND BASIC 
00:08:55 NEIGHBORHOOD SUBS OUR RESIDENTS RELY ON. THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE 
00:09:01 WROTE AT THE TIME THE CRISIS AND I QUOTE "SABOTAGE MUCH OF THE 
00:09:06 CITY FUTURE". THE SCHOOLING OF OUR CHILDREN, THE SIZE OF OUR 
00:09:11 POLICE FORCE, THE WILLINGNESS OF BUSINESSES TO STAY HERE AND 
00:09:16 GROW JOBS. BECAUSE WE WE WERE WILLING TO CHART A DIFFERENT 
00:09:21 COURSE AND TO BREAK WITH THE PAST, WE DID NOT LET A FISCAL 
00:09:25 CRISIS BECOME A ACADEMIC CRISIS. P EVERY YEAR FOR THE PAST 7 
00:09:30 YEARS, A NEW RECORD NUMBER OF CHICAGO STUDENT HAVE GRADUATED 
00:09:34 HIGH SCHOOL, MORE GRADUATES THEN EVER NOW GO TO COLLEGE. 
00:09:39 STANFORD UNIVERSITY FOUND CPS STUDENT ARE LEARNING FASTER THEN 
00:09:44 96 PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS OF ALL DISTRICTS IN THE UNITED 
00:09:49 STATES OF AMERICA. 
00:09:52 (APPLAUSE) 
00:09:59 >> A CHILD WHO IS BORN IN CHICAGO TODAY WILL GET 4 MORE YEARS 
00:10:04 WORTH OF SCHOOL THEN A CHILD BORN JUST A DECADE AGO. WE ARE 
00:10:09 FORTUNATE TO HAVE A CPS GRADUATE, A CPS APPARENT, A CPS 
00:10:16 TEACHER AND CPS PRINCIPLE LEADING THE PROGRESS AND I WANT TO 
00:10:20 ACKNOWLEDGE DR. JANICE JACKSON. 
00:10:24 (APPLAUSE) 
00:10:45 >> I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE JANICE FOR ALL HER HARD WORK ON 
00:10:49 BEHALF OF ALL OF CHICAGO'S CHILDREN. BUT BECAUSE WE ARE 
00:10:53 WILLING TO CHART A DIFFERENT COURSE, AND TO BREAK WITH THE 
00:10:56 PAST, WE DID NOT LET A FISCAL CRISIS EFFECT THE SIZE AND 
00:11:01 STRENGTH OF OUR POLICE FORCE. UNDER LEADERSHIP OF 
00:11:07 SUPERINTENDENT, EDDIE JOHNSON WE ARE GROWING THE SIZE OF THE 
00:11:10 FORCE BY CLOSE TO A THOUSAND ADDITIONAL OFFICERS AND JUST AS 
00:11:13 IMPORTANT WOO WE ARE BRINGING REAL FUNDAMENTAL AND LASTING 
00:11:18 REFORM TO THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON 
00:11:22 IS IN THE CHAMBER WITH US TOED AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE HIM. 
00:11:25 (APPLAUSE) 
00:11:26 >> FOR HIS EXTRAORDINARY LEADERSHIP. AND, BECAUSE WE WERE 
00:11:40 WILLING TO CHART A DIFFERENT COURSE, AND TO BREAK WITH THE 
00:11:45 PAST, RATHER THEN FLEEING MORE BUSINESSES HAVE MOVED THEIR 
00:11:50 HEADQUARTERS TO CHICAGO THEN ANY OTHER AMERICA CITY FOR THE 
00:11:55 LAST 5 YEARS AND THERE ARE MORE JOBS PER CAPITA TODAY IN 
00:11:59 CHICAGO THEN ANY TIME IN THE LAST 5 DECADES. 
00:12:02 (APPLAUSE) 
00:12:06 >> TO THOSE WHO THOUGHT DEMISE AND DECAY WERE PREORDAINED AND 
00:12:15 JUST AROUND THE CORNER, FROM THE SCHOOLING OF OUR CHILDREN TO 
00:12:19 THE STRENGTH AND SIZE OF OUR POLICE FORCE, TO THE SUCCESS OF 
00:12:23 OUR ECONOMY, CHICAGO ACROSS THE CITY SHOWED THE RESOLVE AND 
00:12:28 RESILIENCE THAT DEFINED THE CHARACTER OF THIS GREAT CITY. 7 
00:12:33 YEARS AGO, STANDING RIGHT AT THIS PODIUM, I SAID WE COULD 
00:12:38 START SHAPING OUR FUTURE OR LET OUR FUTURE SHAPE US. THAT WE 
00:12:47 COULD SHOW THE WORLD NO MATTER HOW TOUCH TIMES HAD GOTTEN WE 
00:12:51 CHICAGOANS WERE TOUGHER. TOGETHER THOSE OF US IN THIS ROOM 
00:12:56 AND TAXPAYERS ACROSS CHICAGO STOPPED KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE 
00:13:00 ROAD AND STARTED PUTTING OUR PENSION FUNDS ON THE ROAD TO 
00:13:04 SOLVENCY. ALL 4 FUNDS NOW HAVE DEDICATED REVENUE STREAMS, ALL 
00:13:09 4 FUNDS ARE NOW ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY. WE TRADED GIMMICKS 
00:13:14 AND FINANCIAL GAMES FOR TRUE AND HONEST ACCOUNTING. WE DID 
00:13:20 AWAY WITH SCOOP AND TOSS. PUT AN END OO THE USE OF LONG TERM 
00:13:25 DEBT TO COVER SHORT-TERM COST. WE STOPPED PRIVATIZING PUBLIC 
00:13:31 ASSETS. RATHER THEN RELYING ON RESERVES TO BALANCE THE 
00:13:36 BUDGET, WE HAVE ADDED MONEY TO THE RESERVES EVERY YEAR 7 YEARS 
00:13:41 IN A ROW. WOO HAVE CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN 70 MILLION DOLLARS 
00:13:48 TO THE RAINY DAY BUDGET WE WILL ADD ANOTHER 10 MILLION TO OUR 
00:13:54 RESERVE. WE ARE SENDING A CLEAR STATEMENT WE BELIEVE IN 
00:13:57 SAVING FOR CHICAGO'S FUTURE, NOT MORTGAGING IT. 
00:14:02 (APPLAUSE) 
00:14:08 >> WE REINED IN ONE RUNAWAY HEALTH CARE COSTS WHICH WERE 
00:14:14 GROWING AT 10 PERCENT A YEAR COMPOUNDED. TODAY OUR HEALTHCARE 
00:14:18 BUDGET IS $33 MILLION LOWER THEN THE DAY I TOOK OFFICE. A 7 
00:14:25 PERCENT REDUCTION WHILE HEALTHCARE COSTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
00:14:29 HAVE RISEN BY 30 OR $40 PERCENT. WITH THIS BUDGET, WE WILL 
00:14:34 ACHIEVE ANOTHER $73 MILLION OF LASTING STRUCTURAL REFORMS AND 
00:14:39 SAVINGS. WE'LL SAVE $10 MILLION BY REDUCING THE COST OF 
00:14:44 WORKERS COMPENSATION. WE'LL SAVE MORE THEN $15 MILLION BY 
00:14:47 USING ZERO BASE BUDGETING IN EVERY DEPARTMENT. WE'LL SAVE 
00:14:51 MILLION DOLLARS OF DOLLARS IN ENERGY COST INSTALLING EFFICIENT 
00:14:56 LED STREET LIGHTS WITH MORE SAVINGS IN YEARS AHEAD. LET ME BE 
00:15:03 CLEAR, GETTING THE CITY BACK ON TRACK, I DON'T THINK I HAVE TO 
00:15:09 SAY IT TO YOU, IT HAS NOT BEEN A WALK IN THE PARK AND BY NO 
00:15:13 MEANS IS OUR FINISHED BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE UNDER SELL THE 
00:15:20 JOURNEY WE TOOK AND WORK WE DID IN THIS CHAMBER. WE TOOK 
00:15:23 TOUGH VOTES. YOU DEMONSTRATED INCREDIBLE POLITICAL COURAGE. 
00:15:29 I HAVE BEEN IN POLITICS A LONG TIME. THE ONE THING I LEARNED 
00:15:33 IN THE LAST 24 YEARS, DO NOT BUILD STATUES FOR PEOPLE WHO 
00:15:40 RESTORE FISCAL STABILITY. YOU ARE LAUGHING A LITTLE TOO HARD. 
00:15:45 WITHOUT SOUND, STRONG, STABLE FINANCES NOTHING ELSE IS 
00:15:51 POSSIBLE. BREAKING NEWS--YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET A STATUE, 
00:15:58 BUT YOU HAVE BUILT SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT. MORE 
00:16:02 FUNDAMENTAL, AND MORE LASTING THEN ANY STATUE. YOU HAVE BUILT 
00:16:07 A FOUNDATION AND ON THAT FOUNDATION YOU CAN BUILD A HOME, 
00:16:12 RAISE A FAMILY AND HELP BUILD A NEIGHBORHOOD. ON THAT 
00:16:15 FOUNDATION YOU CAN BUILD BUSINESSES AND JOBS. ON THAT 
00:16:19 FOUNDATION YOU CAN BUILDS A FIRE HOUSE, POLICE STATION OR TECH 
00:16:22 STARTUP. ON THAT FOUNDATION, YOU CREATED WE CAN BUILD AN EVEN 
00:16:27 GREATER CHICAGO. WHILE WE CUT OUR STRUCTURAL DEFICIT BY $538 
00:16:32 MILLION OVER THE LAST 8 YEARS, SIMULTANEOUSLY WE MADE NEW 
00:16:38 INVESTMENT IN NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS THE CITY. IN SMALL 
00:16:41 BUSINESSES THAT CREATED JOBS AND A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND 
00:16:46 ENERGY SAVINGS OF OUR ECONOMY LIKE TECHNOLOGY, ADVANCE 
00:16:48 MANUFACTURING AND TURF WE REJECTED THE FALSE CHOICE OF 
00:16:52 SLASHING GOVERNMENT REGARDLESS OF ITS IMPACT ON OUR RESIDENTS. 
00:16:58 OUR RAISING CITYWIDE TAXES 
00:17:00 WITHOUT REAL STRUCTURAL REFORMS TO ACCOMPANY THEM. WE 
00:17:06 REJECTED THE BAD IDEA OF GETTING BACK ON GARBAGE SERVICE AND 
00:17:10 REPLACED WITH THE GOOD IDEA OF A GRID SYSTEM WHICH ENABLED 
00:17:15 CITYWIDE SERVICE FOR EVERY RESIDENTS NOT JUST SOME. TO HELP 
00:17:22 ADDRESS RISING HEALTHCARE COST WE GAVE AWAY WITH THE OLYMPIC 
00:17:27 [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] WE RESTRUCTURED COPAYS, DEDUCTIBLE, 
00:17:33 PREMIUMS AND SALARY CAPS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER A DECADE. 
00:17:36 BROUGHT DOWN IT THE HIGH PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND PUT 
00:17:39 CITY EMPLOYEES ON A WELLNESS PLAN. MORE IMPORTANTLY HELPED 
00:17:46 OUR WORKFORCE GET HEALTHIER. HEALTHCARE INFLATION THE LAST 8 
00:17:51 YEARS IS UP 30 TO 40 PERCENT I WANT TO REPEAT, WE HAVE BROUGHT 
00:17:56 THE CITY HEALTHCARE BUDGET DOWN BY $33 MILLION AND AT THE SAME 
00:18:01 TIME, WHILE HEALTHCARE COST COMING DOWN, WE INCREASED 
00:18:06 INVESTMENT IN OUR CHILDREN BY $54 MILLION. THE BUDGET IS 
00:18:12 BETTER BALANCED WITH THE PRIORITIES IN THE FUTURE OF THIS 
00:18:16 GREAT CITY. 
00:18:17 (APPLAUSE) 
00:18:20 >> WE CONSOLIDATED THREE SEPARATE CHICAGO TOURISM AGENCIES 
00:18:25 INTO ONE ENTITY TO MARKET THE CITY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND 
00:18:30 GLOBE. ACHIEVED 6 CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF TOURISM. [INAUDIBLE 
00:18:42 COMMENTS] JUST NAMED CHICAGO THE BEST BIG CITY TO VISIT IN 
00:18:47 AMERICA FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW. ADDED MORE THEN 22 
00:18:52 THOUSAND JOBS IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY ALONE. THOSE ARE 
00:18:56 JOBS FOR CHICAGO IN EVERYBODY NEIGHBORHOOD. WE STRENGTHENED A 
00:19:01 $15 BILLION INDUSTRY. OUR WORK TO CREATE FISCAL STABILITY AND 
00:19:05 CERTAINTY WHILE INVESTING MORE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND 
00:19:08 RESIDENTS HAS SPARKED PRIVATE SECTOR CONFIDENT IN THE CITY 
00:19:14 FUTURE. ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS NOT JUST KEPT PACE WITH OTHER 
00:19:19 CITIES ACROSS AMERICA. ON KEY MEASURES WE HAVE GROWN FASTER 
00:19:27 AND GONE FURTHER. WE HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER ONE U.S. CITY IN 
00:19:34 BORN DIRECT INVESTMENT FOR 6 YEARS IN A ROW. IN 2017 THE TOP 
00:19:41 CITIES, LONDON, SINGAPORE, AMSTERDAM AND CHICAGO. THE ONLY 
00:19:49 AMERICAN CITY IN THE TOP 10. CHICAGO IS ONE OF THE SAFEST AND 
00:19:53 STRONGEST INVESTMENTS IN THE WORLD. MORE COMPANIES MOVING TO 
00:19:57 CHICAGO, MORE INVESTMENT SURGING TO CHICAGO ADDS UP TO MORE 
00:20:02 JOBS. TODAY UNEMPLOYMENT AT CHICAGO IS A AT A ALL TIME LOW. 
00:20:07 LAST YEAR CHICAGO ACHIEVED THE LARGEST DROP OF UNEMPLOYMENT IN 
00:20:12 THE 10 LARGEST U.S. CITIES. TECH JOBS ARE GROWING ALL MOST AS 
00:20:17 FAST TODAY AS IN SILICON VALLEY. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE 
00:20:21 PRIVATE SECTOR, WE BUILT A TECH SECTOR FROM THE GROUND UP. 
00:20:24 CREATED NEW INCUBATORS LIKE 1871 RATED THE TOP INCUBATOR IN 
00:20:29 THE WORLD. HUB FOR ADVANCED MANUFACTURING, MATTER FOR 
00:20:34 HEALTHCARE, CURRENT FOR WATER TECHNOLOGY,U I LABS FOR DIGITAL 
00:20:39 ADVANCED MANUFACTURING, THE HATCHERY FOR NEXT GENERATION FOOD 
00:20:42 BUSINESS. THE NET RESULT, RANKED CHICAGO AS THE 6TH STRONGEST 
00:20:51 TECH HUB IN THE WORLD. [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] THE WORLDS NUMBER 
00:20:55 ONE EMERGING TECH HUB. THE HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW CALLED 
00:21:00 GROWTH OF CHICAGO TECH SECTOR IS MODEL FOR OTHER CITIES TO 
00:21:04 FOLLOW. WE DON'T JUST BELIEVE THOSE THINGS, WE DID SOMETHING 
00:21:19 ABOUT THEM. IN ILLINOIS THE MINIMUM WAGE REMAINS STUCK AT 
00:21:24 $18.25 A HOUR. 8 DOLLARS, THANK YOU. THE RABBI AS YOU KNOW 
00:21:33 IN THE JEWISH FAITH, 18 IS TO LIFE, SO WE HAD A RABBI DO THE 
00:21:38 SERMON AND THERE IT GOES. SO GOES THE RABBI SO GOES THE 
00:21:44 SPEECH. THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE IS $7.25 BUT THIS COMING 
00:21:49 JULY, THE MINIMUM WAGE WILL RISE TO $13 AN HOUR. A 40 PERCENT 
00:21:58 INCREASE OVER THE LAST 5 YEARS. 
00:21:59 (APPLAUSE) 
00:22:03 WHEN WE RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE BACK IN 2014, THERE WERE SOME 
00:22:08 VOICES IN THIS CITY WHO SAID THE SKY WOULD FALL. I DON'T WANT 
00:22:15 TO SAY I TOLD YOU SO, BUT I JUST CANT HELP MYSELF. SINCE 
00:22:19 THEIR PREDICTION, CHICAGO ADDED 72 THOUSAND NEW JOBS, 91 
00:22:23 THOUSAND FEWER CHICAGO AND 44 THOUSAND FEWER CHILDREN ARE NOW 
00:22:29 LIVING IN POVERTY IN THE CITY. 
00:22:31 (APPLAUSE) 
00:22:32 WE PROVE FAIR PAY AND GROWING ECONOMY ARE COMPLEMENTARY. 
00:22:41 SINCE WE STARTED RAISING MINIMUM WAGE, CHICAGO UNPRECEDENTED 
00:22:46 BUILDING BOOM HAS NOT ABATED, IT ACCELERATED. TODAY, THERE 
00:22:50 ARE $20 BILLION IN MAJOR PRIVATE SECTOR ACROSS THE CITY. THE 
00:22:58 SHEER NUMBER OF MEGA PROJECTS STANDS OUT MAKING THIS A UNIQUE 
00:23:03 TIME. SINCE THEY MADE THAT OBSERVATION MORE PROJECTS HAVE 
00:23:10 BROKEN DOWN. IT IS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN THE CITY WILLING 
00:23:14 TO SHAPE ITS FUTURE AND NOT SHAPED BY IT. THE STRONGEST 
00:23:18 MEASURE OF CHICAGO'S FUTURE IS NOT NEW BUILD INGS GOING UP OR 
00:23:23 EVEN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE COMING DOWN, IT IS NOT THE NEW 
00:23:29 STARTUP OPENING THEIR DOORS OR RECORD NUMBERS OF COMPANIES, 
00:23:33 INVESTORS AND TOURIST FLOCKING HERE, THE STRONGEST MEASURE OF 
00:23:40 THE FUTURE, THE TRUE HAUL MARK OF OUR COLLECTIVE WORK IS 
00:23:44 PUBLIC OFFICIALS. A REMARKABLE ACADEMIC PROGRESS OF OUR 
00:23:47 CHILDREN. WHEN OUR YOUNGEST STUDENT WERE CAUGHT IN A HALF DAY 
00:23:53 OF KINDERGARTEN COULD WE EXPECT THEM TO COME OUT ON TOP? WHEN 
00:23:58 OUR CHILDREN HAVE THE SHORTEST SCHOOL DAY AND THE SHORTEST 
00:24:03 SCHOOL YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA COULD WE REALLY 
00:24:07 EXPECT THEM TO SUCCEED? WHEN TOO MANY CHILDREN IT TOO FEW 
00:24:11 AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES, SUMMER JOBS, OR MENTORS, COULD WE 
00:24:17 REALLY EXPECT THEM TO REACH THEIR POTENTIAL? WHEN THE STATE 
00:24:21 OF ILLINOIS WAS DEAD LAST IN THE COUNTRY IN EDUCATION FUNDING, 
00:24:27 COULD WE REALLY EXPECT CHICAGO'S CHILDREN TO BEAT THE ODDS? 
00:24:33 AS YOU KNOW, LAST YEAR WITH THE SUPPORT OF SENATE PRESIDENT 
00:24:37 [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] SPEAKER MADIGAN, MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES 
00:24:40 IN THE ILLINOIS HOUSE AND SENATE, WE RETURNED A PAGE ON THAT 
00:24:45 OLD INEQUITY. THE HISTORIC FUNDING FORMULA WE FOUGHT FOR WAS 
00:24:49 PASSED INTO LAW AND CHICAGO STUDENT AND ARE TEACHERS ARE NO 
00:24:54 LONGER SECOND CLASS CITIZENS IN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. 
00:24:57 (APPLAUSE) 
00:24:59 IT WAS A CRUCIAL STEP FOR THE CHILDREN. WHEN YOU STEP BACK 
00:25:13 AND LOOK AT THE ARCH OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE OVER THE LAST 7 
00:25:16 YEARS AND TAKE A WIDE LENS VIEW, FROM AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 
00:25:21 TO SUMMER JOBS, FROM FREE PRE-K TO FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE, 
00:25:28 FROM SAFE PASSAGE ROUTES TO MENTORS, FOR MORE TUTORS IN THE 
00:25:34 NEIGHBORHOOD LIBRARIES TO MORE CAMP COUNSELORS IN THE PARK. 
00:25:37 FREE EYE GLASS SAID TO FREE BOOKS AT OUR LIBRARIES. AT THE 
00:25:42 END OF THE DAY, IT IS REALLY NO DIFFERENT THEN WHAT AMY AND I 
00:25:48 YOU AND YOUR PARTNER DO FOR YOUR OWN CHILDREN. TO ALL THOSE 
00:25:52 PARENTS WHO ARE JUGGLING A JOB AND FAMILY, WE SAID WITH ONE 
00:25:56 VOICE, THE CITY WILL STAND BY YOUR SIDE SO YOU CAN DO BOTH 
00:26:01 WELL AND WE HAVE. 125 THOUSAND CHILDREN IN AFTER SCHOOL 
00:26:07 ACTIVITIES. 32 THOUSAND YOUNG ADULTS WITH A SUMMER JOB. 80 
00:26:12 THOUSAND STUDENT WHO GO TO SCHOOL ON A SAFE PASSAGE ROUTE. 
00:26:16 7800 YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WITH MENTORS. 118 THOUSAND TUTORING 
00:26:23 SESSIONS AT THE LIBRARY. 55 THOUSAND CHILDREN WITH FREE EYE 
00:26:28 EXAM AND GLASSES. 16 THOUSAND 4 YEAR OLDS IN PRE- K. 24 
00:26:34 THOUSAND 5 YEAR OLDS IN FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. MORE IN THE 6 
00:26:38 THOUSAND CPS GRADUATES GOING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR FREE. 
00:26:43 (APPLAUSE) 
00:26:45 CHICAGO'S CHILDREN ARE DOING THEIR PART BY SETTING RECORDS IN 
00:26:54 THE CLASSROOM. THEY HAVE RISEN TO THE CHALLENGE. THEY ARE 
00:27:00 CHOOSING TO SHAPE THEIR OWN FUTURES NOT LET THEIR FUTURES 
00:27:03 SHAPE THEM. OUR SCHOOLS CEO JANICE JACKSON WILL BE THE FIRST 
00:27:09 TO TELL YOU, FOR CHILDREN TO SUCCEED IN THE CLASSROOM THEY 
00:27:13 NEED TO BE SUPPORTED OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM. THANKS FOR 
00:27:19 CHURCH. THINK ABOUT IT, FOR EVERY YEAR WE INVESTED MORE IN 
00:27:24 THE CHILDREN WITH RECORD NUMBER OF SUMMER JOBS, CHICAGO'S 
00:27:27 GRADUATION WENT UP. IT IS AT A RAILROAD 78.2 PERCENT AND 
00:27:31 GROWING. EVERY YEAR WE INVESTED MORE IN OUR CHILDREN WITH 
00:27:34 AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES, AFTER SCHOOL MATTERS AND CHICAGO PARK 
00:27:39 DISTRICT, CHICAGO FRESHMAN ON TRACK RATE WENT UP AND NOW A 
00:27:46 RECORD 89 PERCENT. 
00:27:48 (APPLAUSE) 
00:27:49 >> FOR EVERY YEAR WE INVESTED MORE IN OUR CHILDREN WITH A 
00:27:54 RECORD NUMBER OF MENTORS AND COLLEGE COUNSELORS, MORE HIGH 
00:27:58 SCHOOL STUDENT ENROLL IN COLLEGE, 68 PERCENT OF CPS GRADUATES 
00:28:03 NOW ENROLL IN COLLEGE. LAST YEAR OUR KIDS EARNED MORE THEN 
00:28:09 $1.3 BILLION IN SCHOLARSHIPS. WHEN THAT MANY YOUNG PEOPLE 
00:28:14 MAKE THAT MUCH PROGRESS, IT MEANS THE WHOLE SIT A EIS DOING 
00:28:17 SOMETHING RIGHT. PARENTS AND TEACHERS, PRINCIPLES AND 
00:28:23 PASTORS, COACHES AND COLLEGE COUNSELORS, TUTORS AND MENTORS, 
00:28:28 IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF A YOUNG PERSON'S LIFE, 
00:28:32 YOU HAVE TO BE A PART OF IT,ING YOU HAVE TO BE PRESENT. 
00:28:36 SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON CAN ATTEST TO THIS. THE CHICAGO POLICE 
00:28:40 DEPARTMENT ONGOING FIGHT AND PROGRESS AGAINST CRIME IS 
00:28:44 STRENGTHENED NOT JUST BY MORE BEAT OFFICERS AND BY MORE YOUNG 
00:28:48 MEN AND WOMEN WITH MENTORS. NOT JUST SUPPORT CENTERS BUT MORE 
00:28:56 AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD SAID. NOT JUST 
00:28:59 NEW BODY CAMERAS AND TASERS BUT MORE EX-OFFENDER GIVEN A 
00:29:04 SECOND CHANCE BECAUSE I FAILED SYSTEM NEVER GIVE THEM A FIRST 
00:29:09 CHANCE. 
00:29:10 (APPLAUSE) 
00:29:14 JUST THE ORT OTHER DAY I WAS AT AN EVENT SPONSORED BY LISLE 
00:29:20 UNIVERSITY. GENTLEMEN WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR RUNNING THE 
00:29:26 BUILDING WE WERE IN, MAN NAME CHRISTOF COLLIN, AS I WAS

00:29:51 OFF WORKING PART OF YOUR CTA PILOT PROGRAM FOR EX-OFFENDERS. 
00:29:57 BEFORE THE SECOND CHANCE PROGRAM HE DIDN'T HAVE A JOB, HE 
00:30:02 COULDN'T PROVIDE FOR HIS FAMILY, HE HAD BECOME HOMELESS: THE 
00:30:08 SECOND CHANCE PROGRAM HELPED HIM GET BACK ON HIS FEET. IF YOU 
00:30:14 DON'T WANT A EX-OFFENDER TO BE A REPEAT OFFENDER, A JOB. 
00:30:18 (APPLAUSE) 
00:30:19 TODAY CHRISTOF IS WORKING FULL-TIME MANAGING THE BUILDING. HE 
00:30:31 IS SUPPORTING HIS FAMILY AND HERE'S WHAT IS INCREDIBLE, IN HIS 
00:30:37 FREE TIME HE GIVES BACK TO HELP THE HOMELESS IN THE CITY OF 
00:30:40 CHICAGO NEVER FORGETTING HIS JOURNEY. 
00:30:43 (APPLAUSE) 
00:30:46 CHRISTOF IS WITH US THIS MORNING IN THE CHAMBER. TRYING TO 
00:30:50 FIND HIM HERE. CHRISTOF-RIGHT THERE. 
00:30:53 (APPLAUSE) THIS BUDGET WILL SUPPORT 2600 OTHER MEN AND WOMEN 
00:31:17 FOLLOW CHRISTOF'S JOURNEY BACK INTO THE WORKFORCE AND BACK 
00:31:21 INTO BEING A GOOD APPARENT. THANK YOU, CHRISTOF FOR BEING 
00:31:24 HERE. THE SOLUTIONS TO OUR PUBLIC SAFETY CHALLENGES DO NOT 
00:31:28 REST ON OUR POLICE OFFICERS ALONE. IT IS NOT FAIR, IT IS NOT 
00:31:33 RIGHT, AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE HAVE TO GO. WITH THIS 
00:31:37 BUDGET, WE ALSO PROVIDE MENTORS FOR ADDITIONAL 600 7TH GRADE 
00:31:44 YOUNG MEN BRINGING THE TOTAL TO 7800 STUDENT IN 7TH, 8TH, 9TH,

00:33:28 CHILDREN OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
00:33:31 (APPLAUSE) 
00:33:32 IN MY SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS IN 2015 I FOCUSED ON THE LOST 
00:34:00 YOUNG MEN IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO. WE PASSED THEM ON THE 
00:34:05 STREETS. WE DON'T REALLY SEE THEM. WHEN WE THINK OF THEM AT 
00:34:14 ALL, WE THINK THEY ARE SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM. WE ARE ALL 
00:34:22 RESPONSIBLE FOR GIVING THEM A CHANCE IN LIFE. I SAID IN MY 
00:34:29 SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS WHICH I DEDICATED TO THOSE YOUNG MEN, 
00:34:33 WHEN YOUNG MEN JOIN GANGS IN SEARCH OF PRAISE, WE MUST DO 
00:34:39 BETTER. WHEN YOUNG MEN TURN TO LIVES OF CRIME FOR HOPE, WE 
00:34:44 MUST DO BETTER. WHEN PRISON IS THERE PLACE WE SEND BOYS TO 
00:34:48 BECOME MEN, WE MUST DO BETTER. IF THEY CAN CHANGE THE 
00:34:52 DIRECTION OF THEIR LIVES, WITH THE SUPPORT OF A SUMMER JOB, 
00:34:57 AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITY OR A MENTOR, WE [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] 
00:35:04 LAST WEEK, I RECEIVED A LETTER I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU. 
00:35:08 I WAS TRYING TO EXPRESS WHAT [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] I COULDN'T 
00:35:14 THINK OF A BETTER WAY TO DO IT UNTIL I GOT THIS LETTER. DEAR 
00:35:25 MR. MAYOR, MY NAME IS RAJAY MONTGOMERY, I'M A SENIOR AT JOHN 
00:35:34 MARSHAL HIGH SCHOOL LOCATED ON THE WEST SIDE OF CHICAGO. I 
00:35:41 LIKE TO BEGIN MY JOURNEY BEFORE BECOMING A LIFE MEMBER OF BAM. 
00:35:47 I'M A GOOD KID. I'M A GOOD PERSON, BUT I WAS EXPERIENCING 
00:35:51 TOUGH ROUGH PATCHES AND NEGATIVE NOTIONS. I FELT NO ONE 
00:35:56 REALLY CARED ABOUT ME ACCEPT MY MOTHER AND GRANDMA. WAS I 
00:36:04 CONCERNED OR PRODUCTIVE STUDENT? NO. THAT WASN'T ME. I 
00:36:09 COULDN'T FOCUS. I OFTEN ASKED MYSELF, WHY AM I HERE. WHY 
00:36:15 COME TO SCHOOL. FRESHMAN YEAR I NEVER SAW OR MET ANY MALES 
00:36:21 THAT LOOKED LIKE ME LEAD SUCCESSFUL LIVES. DAY AFTER DAY I 
00:36:25 SAW MEN ON THE STREETS USING OR SELLING DRUGS. THESE WERE 
00:36:31 PEOPLE I PERSONALLY KNEW AND I WAS GROWING UP AROUND THEM. I 
00:36:38 SAW THEM GIVE UP ON SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SUPPORT. MY 
00:36:42 SOPHOMORE YEAR SECOND SEMESTER, I JOINED BAM. SINCE JOINING I 
00:36:51 NOTICED THAT MY STREET HABITS LEFT. I BECOME MORE INVESTED IN 
00:36:56 MY LIFE AND INVOLVED IN SCHOOL. MY ATTENDANCE IS BETTER. MY 
00:37:02 MENTAL FOCUS IS BETTER AND ALL THIS SHOWED UP IN MY GRADES. 
00:37:08 THEY ARE AMAZING. I OBSERVE MY BAM PEERS AT SCHOOL GAIN 
00:37:15 CONFIDENCE IN THEMSELVES. BECAUSE OF THAT, A LOT OF GOOD 
00:37:22 THINGS STARTED HAPPENING FOR THEM. MR. DORSEY ALSO KNOWN AS 
00:37:26 MY POPS, WAS THE BAM COUNSELOR AT MARSHAL. HE RECRUITED ME, 
00:37:34 HE HELPED ME OUT EVERY SINGLE DAY, NOT JUST DURING SCHOOL 
00:37:38 HOURS, BUT WHEN EVER I NEEDED HIM. MY POPS IS ALWAYS THERE. 
00:37:43 HE CHALLENGED ME DAILY DRILLED INTEGRITY, ACCOUNTABILITY, SELF 
00:37:48 DETERMINATION AND POSITIVE ANGER EXPRESSION, RESPECT FOR 
00:37:51 WOMANHOOD AND VISIONARY GOAL SETTING. OUR BAM CORE VALUES. 
00:37:56 HE ALWAYS MADE US FEEL LIKE WE BELONGED AND WE WERE IMPORTANT. 
00:38:00 AFTER I GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL THIS JUNE 2019, I PLAN TO ATTEND 
00:38:07 MISSISSIPPI VALLEY STATE UNIVERSITY. 
00:38:09 (APPLAUSE) I PLAN TO MAJOR IN BUSINESS AND OF COURSE MR. 
00:38:22 DORSEY HELPED ME GET INTO THE UNIVERSITY. HE TOOK ME THERE ON 
00:38:27 A COLLEGE TOUR. BECAUSE OF HIM AND BAM, I WILL CONTINUE TO 
00:38:32 CHASE MY DREAMS AND FOCUS ON MYSELF AND MAKE SURE THAT I 
00:38:36 BECOME VERY SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE BECAUSE I MUST PAY IT FORWARD. 
00:38:41 MR. MAYOR, I'M JUST SAYING, THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING YOUTH 
00:38:45 GUIDANCE AND BAM. MEETING MR. DORSEY CHANGED MY LIFE. THANK 
00:38:52 YOU TO YOU AND THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO FOR 
00:38:55 SUPPORTING US. BEST, RAJAY MONTGOMERY. 
00:39:02 (APPLAUSE) 
00:39:08 >> RAJAY AND MR. DORSEY ARE WITH US IN THE CHAMBER THIS 
00:39:17 MORNING AND I LIKE TO IS ASK THEM TO PLEASE STAND UP. 
00:39:20 (APPLAUSE) 
00:39:21 WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INVEST IN RAJAY, MR. DORSEY, CHRISTOF, 
00:39:53 AND THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO BECAUSE WE 
00:39:56 HAVE DONE THE HARD WORK PUTTING OUR FISCAL HOUSE AND 
00:39:59 PRIORITIES IN ORDER. THIS BUDGET BUILDS ON THE STUDY PROGRESS 
00:40:02 WE MADE TOGETHER OVER THE PAST 7 YEARS. PUBLIC OFFICIALS, 
00:40:09 PRIVATE CITIZENS, FORTUNE 500 EXECUTIVES, SMALL BUSINESS 
00:40:14 OWNERS MEMBERS OF MY CABINET AND NEIGHBORHOOD BLOCK CLUBS ALL 
00:40:19 WITH A ORE IN THE WATER GUIDED BY THE SAME NORTH STAR OF A 
00:40:23 BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR OUR CITY AND OUR CHILDREN. THERE IS WORK 
00:40:27 WE HAVE DONE TOGETHER THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE AS CLEAR AS 
00:40:31 DAYLIGHT. A MODERNIZED MIDWAY. REVITALIZED RIVER IN LAKE 
00:40:37 FRONT. NEW SCHOOLS AND SCIENCE LABS WITH COMPUTERS FOR EVERY 
00:40:40 STUDENT. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION CENTERS IN THE 
00:40:43 NEIGHBORHOOD AND NEW CAREER CENTERS FOR RETOOLED CITY COLLEGE. 
00:40:47 A NEW UNION STATION, NEW CTA STATIONS. NEW NEIGHBORHOOD 
00:40:51 BRANCH LIBRARIES AND THE OBAMA PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY. NEW LIFE 
00:40:55 FOR THE OLD POST OFFICE,IC AND NEW GROCERY STORES AND FORMER 
00:41:00 FOOD DESERTS. NEW SPACE FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
00:41:06 AND HOMES FOR VETERANS WHO WERE HOMELESS. THERE IS WORK WE 
00:41:09 HAVE DONE TOGETHER THAT WE CANNOT SEE, BUT THAT WILL BENEFIT 
00:41:15 CHICAGO FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
00:41:18 THROUGH THE STAR SCHOLARSHIP. FREE UNIVERSAL FULL DAY PRE-K. 
00:41:24 FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. THE SUMMER JOB THAT IS A GATEWAY 
00:41:29 CAREER IN CODING. THE AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITY THAT IS A CALL 
00:41:33 SCHOLARSHIP. THE CHILD WHO WALKS TO SCHOOL ON A SAFE PASSAGE 
00:41:38 ROUTE AND ATTENDANCE AND GRADES GO UP. THE STUDENT WITH 
00:41:41 EYEGLASSES WHO CAN NOW SEE THE CHALKBOARD AND THE BOOK IN 
00:41:45 FRONT OF THEM. THE YOUNG MAN OR WOMAN WITH A MENTOR THAT 
00:41:48 HELPS SHAPE THEIR FUTURE NOT BE SHAPED BY IT. ALL OF THIS 
00:41:52 ADDS UP TO THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN A 
00:41:56 CHANCE AND A CHOICE BECAUSE THEY CAN NOW BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES 
00:41:59 AGAIN. WHEN I MADE THE DIFFICULT DECISION NOT TO SEEK 
00:42:04 REELECTION, I SAID OUR DUTY AS PUBLIC SERVANT IS DO THE BEST 
00:42:10 WE CAN AND THEN PASS THE TORCH. LET US CHALLENGE THOSE WHO 
00:42:15 SIT IN THIS HISTORIC CHAMBER OR STAND AT THIS ROSTRUM IN THE 
00:42:20 FUTURE TO REMEMBER THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT COMES WITH THAT 
00:42:23 TORCH. IF OUR LEADERS RESPOND MONEY WE DON'T HAVE, THEY WILL 
00:42:28 STEAL THE FUTURE OUR CHILDREN COULD HAVE HAD. IF OUR LEADERS 
00:42:32 MAKE PHONY PROMISES INSTEAD OF TOUGH CHOICES IT IS COUNTLESS 
00:42:37 KIDS IN TOUCH NEIGHBORHOODS WHO'S TRUE PROMISE THEY SCHOOL AND 
00:42:42 TOSS. IF OUR LEADERS RUN UP DEBT AND RUN DOWN PENSIONS AND 
00:42:46 RUN DRY THE RAINY DAY FUND, IT ST. THE NEXT GENERATION WHO'S 
00:42:50 CHANCES RUN OUT. IF WE WANT TO SHOW THE NEXT GENERATION 
00:42:55 CHARACTER MATTERS WE HAVE TO PASS THE TEST OF CHARACTER 
00:42:58 OURSELVES. THE BEST PART IS, GREAT THINGS HAPPEN WHEN WE DO. 
00:43:03 WHEN WE LIVE UP TO OUR RESPONSIBILITIES, MORE YOUNG PEOPLE IN 
00:43:06 CHICAGO GET THE VALUES AND EXPERIENCE THAT COME WITH THE 
00:43:09 SUMMER JOB. WHEN WE CONFRONT CHALLENGES INSTEAD OF DUCKING 
00:43:13 THEM, MORE STUDENT IN CHICAGO HAVE A SAFE PLACE AFTER SCHOOL 
00:43:18 THAT HELPS DEVELOP A SENSE OF WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY WANT 
00:43:22 TO BECOME. WHEN WE DO WHAT IS NECESSARY INSTEAD OF WHAT IS 
00:43:25 EASY, MORE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN HAVE A MENTOR WHO CAN HELP 
00:43:28 CHANGE THEIR CHANCES FOR A LIFE TIME. WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER 
00:43:34 TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD, FOR OUR CHILDREN, THEIR FUTURE IS 
00:43:39 BRIGHTER AND CHICAGO BEST DAYS ARE NOT BEHIND US, THEY ARE 
00:43:43 STILL TO COME. IT HAS BEEN THE HONOR OF MY CAREER TO WORK 
00:43:47 ALONGSIDE EACH OF YOU AND I WILL FOREVER BE PROFOUNDLY 
00:43:53 GRATEFUL FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF A LIFE TIME TO SERVE THE

00:53:38 >> GOOD MORNING. THE CITY OF CHICAGO CLAIMS TO HAVE BALANCED 
00:53:44 THE BUDGET REQUIRED BY STATE LAW BUT EVERY YEAR SINCE 2011 THE 
00:53:48 CITY EXPENSES EXCEEDED THE REVENUE BY OVER A BILLION DOLLARS A 
00:53:53 YEAR ON AVERAGE. THE QUESTION ARISES WHY CAN THIS HAPPEN? 
00:53:57 OVER THAT SAME TIME THE CITY INTEREST EXPENSES ALL MOST 
00:54:01 DOUBLED. WE PAY OVER $700 MILLION IN INTEREST LAST YEAR ALONE 
00:54:07 AS WE RUN UP THE CREDIT CARDS AND AT THE SAME TIME WE TELL THE 
00:54:10 CITIZENS WE BALANCE OUR BUDGET AND I THINK PART OF THE ANSWER 
00:54:12 LIES AND HOPE THE CITY COUNCIL WOULD CONSIDER SUPPORTING 
00:54:16 EFFORTS AT THE GOVERNMENTAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD TO MOVE 
00:54:19 TO A FULL ACCRUAL BASIS IN BUDGETING AND KEEP THIS FROM

00:55:14 LOT OF HITS BY MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS BECAUSE HE IS THE 
00:55:18 ONE THAT HAD THE RESPONSIBILITY, BUT I WANT TO SAY TO ALL YOU 
00:55:21 ALDERMAN, THEY MADE THE RIGHT DECISION TO PASS THE BUDGET AND 
00:55:28 MAKE SOME OF THE DECISIONS A LOT OF PEOPLE WITHIN OUR CITY 
00:55:31 DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAD THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE 
00:55:34 THINGS HAPPEN IN CITY OF CHICAGO WHEN IT IS ROUGH. I HEARD 
00:55:40 THE MAYOR MAKE MENTION ABOUT THE JOBS FOR THE EX-FELONS WITH 
00:55:46 CTA, THAT COULDN'T HAVE HAPPEN WITHOUT YOU GUYS VOTING FOR IT 
00:55:51 TO HAPPEN. I KNOW THERE IS ELECTION COMING UP IN 2019, I HOPE 
00:55:58 Y'ALL STAND STRONG WITH OUR RESPONSIBILITY THAT Y'ALL GAVE TO 
00:56:03 THE CITY TO HELP THE MAYOR MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS. EVERYBODY 
00:56:08 THINK THEY CAN RUN FOR OFFICE, I THOUGHT I COULD RUN FOR 
00:56:12 OFFICE TOO. EVERYBODY GOT A RIGHT TO RUN FOR OFFICE, BUT 
00:56:17 WHERE THEY TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THE DECISIONS TO 
00:56:22 HELP MAKE THE CITY RUN. I WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR FOR THE 
00:56:27 TIME THAT HE DID SERVE THE CITY. I KNOW THE POSITION THAT THE 
00:56:33 CITY WAS IN BEFORE HE CHANGED THINGS AROUND AND THE THINGS I 
00:56:39 HEARD TODAY. I DIDN'T REALIZE ALL THE WORK HE DID WHICH Y'ALL 
00:56:46 SUPPORT UNTIL I SAW THE BAM SITUATION. I SAW MY [INAUDIBLE 
00:56:51 COMMENTS] OVER HERE, THAT MADE DECISIONS THAT BELIEVED THAT HE 
00:56:57 COULD PICK UP A CIGARETTE BUTT OFF OF A L PLATFORM TO NOW WORK 
00:57:05 FOR CTA SO I WANT TO SAY TO ALL YOU ALDERMAN, STAND FAST, 
00:57:14 STAND FAST, AND STAY STRONG.

00:58:43 MADAM CLERK, DO WE HAVE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES? 
00:58:48 >> YES. KATHLEEN POWERS. 
00:59:09 >> GOOD MORNING EVERYONE. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO 
00:59:13 SPEAK. I'M REALLY SORRY THAT THE MAYOR DIDN'T CHOOSE TO 
00:59:19 LISTEN TO THE PUBLIC COMMENTARY. I AM A MEMBER OF THE 
00:59:24 COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH BOARD, AND I WANT TO SAY THAT 7 YEARS 
00:59:30 AGO WE HAD 12 MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS. 6 YEARS AGO WE HAD 6 
00:59:39 MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS. AS OF LAST YEAR, WE HAVE 5 MENTAL 
00:59:48 HEALTH CLINICS AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE STATE OF THE 
00:59:51 CLINICS THAT WE HAVE. THEY ARE BOARDED UP GARAGES, THEY ARE 
00:59:56 PAPERED IN WINDOWS WITH THE MAYORS NAME AS MAYOR DALY. MR. 
01:00:21 [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] WILL HAVE TELEPSYCHOLOGY. THE OPIOID 
01:00:37 CRISIS I AM A SUICIDE SURVIVOR. I WEAR THIS ALL THE TIME AND 
01:00:43 LET ME TELL YOU, MENTAL HEALTH MATTERS, MENTAL HEALTH MATTERS 
01:00:51 AND IT'S-I THINK IT IS SHAMEFUL HOW THE CITY HAS TREATED THE 
01:00:57 MENTALLY ILL. INCLUDING THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, THE POLICE 
01:01:02 DEPARTMENT HAS ITS OWN SPECIAL MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS, AS OUR 
01:01:09 OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. NOBODY IS 
01:01:14 PAYING ATTENTION TO THESE. THE STIGMA IS SO STRONG THAT IT IS 
01:01:19 GOING TO TAKE AN ACT OF CONGRESS I THINK TO STOP IT, BUT IT 
01:01:24 HAS GOT TO STOP. AND THEN, THERE IS OUR HOMELESS PEOPLE. HOW 
01:01:29 CAN YOU BE MENTALLY HEALTHY IF YOU DONT HAVE A HOME? WHY 
01:01:38 DOESN'T THE MAYOR ACTUALLY CONDONE THE TINY HOUSES? THIS 
01:01:44 WOULD AT LEAST BE A SURVIVORSHIP IN THIS CITY. THAT IS ALL I 
01:01:49 HAVE TO SAY. THANK YOU. 
01:01:51 (APPLAUSE) 
01:01:52 >> THANK YOU. THE NEXT SPEAKER IS DIANE ADAMS. 
01:01:59 >> HELLO. MY NAME IS DIANE ADAMS. I'M WITH STOP, SOUTH SIDE

01:02:08 THE CITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH. I'M ALSO A VOLUNTEER FOR MENTAL 
01:02:12 HEALTH. MY QUESTION IS TODAY,ER IN 2012 WE CAME TO THE MAYOR 
01:02:19 AND TOLD THE MAYOR THAT EVERYTHING IS HAPPENING IN THE CITY OF 
01:02:24 CHICAGO IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THE HOMELESS, DISPLACEMENT OF THE 
01:02:29 PEOPLE THAT DON'T GET THEY MEDICINE, THAT WE HAVE PSYCHIATRIST 
01:02:35 THERE GAVE SHOTS. WE DONT HAVE THEM NO MORE. WHEN THE 
01:02:40 PSYCHIATRIST RETIRE THEY DONT WANT TO REPLACE THEM MORE. THE 
01:02:46 THERAPIST THEY DON'T WANT TO REPLACE THEM. I'M A PRODUCT OF 
01:02:51 WEST 79TH STREET. TO TOOK 13 YEARS TO GET TO WHERE I'M AT 
01:02:56 TODAY BECAUSE I HAD A GOOD THERAPIST AND PSYCHIATRIST THAT 
01:03:01 TOLD ME ABOUT MY ILLNESS AND MY MEDICATION. AT THE TIME I 
01:03:06 STARTED MAKING GOALS FOR MYSELF. I LOST A CHILD, MY CHILD WAS 
01:03:12 18 YEARS OLD WHEN I LOST HIM, AND 98 I TRIED TO COMMIT 
01:03:20 SUICIDE. IN 2005 I WAS IN A COMA FOR 8 MONTHS AND OUT OF 
01:03:24 COMMISSION FOR A YEAR. LOOK AT ME TODAY. SO, YOU CAN'T TELL 
01:03:28 ME WHAT MENTAL HEALTH CAN'T DO. ALL WE IS AND IS REOPEN THE 
01:03:39 MENTAL HEALTH CENTERS [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] YOU HAVE PEOPLE 
01:03:48 COMING OUT OF IRAQ. THEY GOT MENTAL ILLNESS. WE GOT 5 
01:03:52 CLINICS AND NOW WE ARE ASKING THE MAYOR TO STEP UP OPEN AT 
01:03:57 LEAST ONE OR TWO. I WANT TO KNOW WHERE DID THE MONEY THAT 
01:04:02 [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] GAVE FOR MENTAL HEALTH, WHERE DO IT FITS 
01:04:05 IN THE 5 CLINICS? ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS MENTAL HEALTH IS 
01:04:11 IMPORTANT, AND WE NEED MORE MONEY AND MORE FUNDING AND WE HAD 
01:04:16 28 ALDERMAN IN AGREEMENT NOT TO CLOSE THE CENTER BUT WHEN THE 
01:04:23 MAYOR STOOD UP AND SAID I GOT 50 ALDERMAN AND ONLY NEED 25, 
01:04:28 THEY RENEGED ON US. WE ONLY HAVE ONE ALDERMAN-FORGOT HER NAME 
01:04:34 AND CAME FORWARD AND OMIT IT WAS WRONG. I ASK ALL Y'ALL 
01:04:39 ALDERMAN TO GET WITH THE MAYOR, TRY TO GIVE US BACK THESE 
01:04:42 CENTERS BECAUSE YOU SEE THE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS AT THE BUS 
01:04:47 STOP [INAUDIBLE COMMENTS] AIN'T NOBODY WAKE UP AND SAY I'M
