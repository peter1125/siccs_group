00:08:16 I'M HERE TO SHOW MY SUPPORT FOR ORDINANCE 2017-8598 TO END HORSE 
00:08:26 DRAWN CARRIAGES IN CHICAGO. 
00:08:28 OUR BUSY STREETS IS NO PLACE BY HORSE. 
00:08:33 THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY LOUD CARS, BUSES, AMBULANCES SIRENS AND HORNS 
00:08:37 IN ORDER TO COPE WITH ALL THE STRESS, THE HORSES SHUT DOWN 
00:08:41 EMOTIONALLY. 
00:08:45 THEY'RE TETHERED TO A CARRIAGE WITH BLINDERS ON. 
00:08:49 THEY'RE BASICALLY TURN TO GO MACHINE. 
00:08:53 OFTEN TIMES THEY WORK 10-12, 13 HOURS STRAIGHT IN ONE DAY. 
00:08:59 I HAVE WATCHED THE HORSES START AT NOON AND HEAD BACK TO THE PENS 12 
00:09:03 HOURS LATER. 
00:09:05 AND I WONDER, IS THIS THE DAY THAT A HORSE COLLAPSE AND CAN'T GET 
00:09:09 BACK UP. 
00:09:12 WHY ARE WE RUNNING THAT RISK? 
00:09:15 HORSES ARE NOT MACHINES AND THEY DESERVE FREEDOMS LIKE WE DO. 
00:09:20 DO. 
00:09:22 WINTER IS COMING, AND THIS IS A VERY COLD DANGEROUS WORK THAT NEEDS 
00:09:26 TO COME TO AN END. 
00:09:28 IT'S NOT ROMANTIC OR CHARMING, SOMEBODY IS SUFFERING. 
00:09:35 PEOPLE ARE WAKING UP TO WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ANIMALS. 
00:09:38 AND PEOPLE CARE. 
00:09:40 THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS FOR THE FIRST CARRIAGE BAN. 
00:09:45 WE HAVE 17,000 SIGNATURES FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD ON OUR PETITION 
00:09:50 SUPPORTING THE HORSE CARRIAGE BAN. 
00:09:53 AND OUR NUMBERS ARE GROWING.

00:10:03 CITIES IN MISSISSIPPI, NEW JERSEY, FLORIDA, NEVADA, NEW MEXICO AND 
00:10:08 SOUTH CAROLINA ALL HAVE BANS. 
00:10:10 ADDING CHICAGO TO THIS LIST WILL SHOW THAT WE'RE PROGRESSIVE FORWARD 
00:10:16 THINKING PASSIONATE CITY. 
00:10:17 WE WANT TO BE PROUD OF THE DOESINGS THAT OUR CITY COUNCIL MAKES THAT 
00:10:25 REFLECTS COMPASSIONATE VALUES. 
00:10:27 FOR A CITY THAT DOES NOT VOLVE ANIMAL EXPLOITATION. 
00:10:32 AS VOLUNTEERS FOR CHICAGO ALLIANCE FOR ANIMALS, WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
00:10:37 DOCUMENT AND REPORT THE DANGEROUS LAW VIOLATIONS COMMITTED WEEKLY BY 
00:10:41 THE CARRIAGE COMPANIES. 
00:10:43 IT'S NOT TOO LATE CITY COUNCIL, PLEASE GIVE ORDINANCE 201798 A VOTE. 
00:10:53 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. 
00:10:55 >> THANK YOU, THE NEXT SPEAKER IS SANDRA. 
00:11:07 >> GOOD MOANSINGER MAYOR EMANUEL AND CHICAGO CITY COUNCIL. 
00:11:12 I'M SAND RA, THANK YOU FOR THIS ORDINANCE, 02017--IS NOT TO RENEW 
00:11:25 HORSE CARRIAGE LICENSES. 
00:11:27 IT'S NOT HOW I DO OR ANIMAL ADVOCATES FEEL ABOUT THIS TRADE. 
00:11:33 WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO, IS THAT THREE COMPANIES DOCUMENTED FOR 
00:11:36 BREAKING THE LAW. 
00:11:40 334 TIMES IN 2017. 
00:11:43 IMAGINE ROMANTIC QUAINT RESTAURANT IN THE HEART OF THE MILE THAT DREW 
00:11:47 IN TOURIST BUT THEY BROKE THE LAW, 334 TIMES LAST YEAR! 
00:11:53 AS A DECISION MAKER, DO YOU THINK THAT THIS RESTAURANT SHOULD GET 
00:11:58 THEIR LICENSE RENEWED. 
00:12:00 THAT'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND? 
00:12:03 WHY THAT THAT ALDERMAN MITT REFUSE TO GIVE A VOTE AND GIVE US A 
00:12:11 STANCE. 
00:12:13 AS WE'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE, WE'VE DOCUMENTED THE HORSE CARRIAGE 
00:12:19 CHAUFFER OVERWORKING THESE HORSES TIME AND TIME AGAIN. 
00:12:23 WE WITNESSED T.IN ADDITION, THEY ALSO ROUTINELY BREAK LAWS THAT 
00:12:28 IMPACT PUBLIC SAFETY. 
00:12:30 MY QUESTION TO YOU TODAY IS WHY? 
00:12:34 WHY IS IT THAT OKAY FOR BUSINESSES TO BREAK THE LAW IN CHICAGO. 
00:12:38 AND IF IT'S NOT OKAY, WHY SHOULD THESE CARRIAGE COMPANIES GET THEIR 
00:12:43 LICENSES RENEWED AT THE END OF THE MONTH? 
00:12:45 I WOULD LIKE TO READ A TESTIMONY FROM SALT LAKE CITY COUNCIL. 
00:12:57 I SERVED FOR SIX YEARS AND I HAD THE EFFORT OF END CARRIAGE, AMONG 
00:13:04 MANY HARD CALLS DURING THIS ALMOST 7 YEARS ENDING THE USE OF HORSE 
00:13:10 CARRIAGES WAS A NECESSARY TRAFFIC I TOOK ON WITHOUT ANY HESITATION. 
00:13:14 SALT LAKE CITY BAN ON HORSE CARRIAGES CAME ON THE HEELS OF WIDELY PU 
00:13:21 WILL I SIZED WITH A HORSE NAME JERSEY WHO WAS PULLING A CARRIAGE AT 
00:13:27 98 TEMPERATURES AND IT COLLAPSED IN THE STREET. 
00:13:31 IT WAS QUICKLY DISCOVERED THAT JERSEY CASE WAS NOT ISOLATED INCIDENT. 
00:13:35 POLICE AND PATROL SHOW THAT ANOTHER HORSE COLLAPSED ALSO AND DIED ON 
00:13:41 THE STREETS OF SALT LAKE CITY JUST TWO YEARS PRIOR. 
00:13:48 RECORD OF HORSING RUNNING THROUGH THE TRAFFIC, DODGING CARS AND TRAIN 
00:13:53 CAUSING DANGEROUS INCIDENTS. 
00:13:55 I BELIEVE WE ARE SO LUCKY THAT NO PERSON HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT. 
00:14:02 I URGE YOU TO DOT RIGHT THING TODAY. 
00:14:06 >> THANK YOU. 
00:14:09 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS BRITNEY BRANDT.

00:14:39 AS WELL AS 17,000 DOCUMENTED PEOPLE THAT HORSE DRAWN CARRIAGES ARE 
00:14:43 READY TO BE RETIRED FROM THE CITY WITH AN ISSUE OF I BELIEVE UNITES 
00:14:47 US ALL. 
00:14:50 I HAVE A SINKING FEELING IN MY GUT EVERY TIME I SEE A HORSE ON THE 
00:14:57 STREET I FEEL THAT I KNOW WE ALL GET. 
00:15:01 I BELIEVE IN CORRECTING THIS AND IT MAKES OUR CITY MISTREAT. 
00:15:08 HORSE DRAWN XAIRJZ MAKE SENSE IN THE 19th CENTURY BUT THEY NO LONGER 
00:15:14 SERVE A PUFRMENT AS A MATTER OF FACT, LAST CARRIAGE I SAW UP THE 
00:15:22 CHAUFFER REPRESENTING AN ASPECT OF CHICAGO TOURISM WAS EXHIBITING 
00:15:31 VERY BAD HAND GESTURES WITH THE LADY IN THE HORSE CARRIAGE. 
00:15:37 WE'RE AN INCED ABBY DIVERSE CITY WITH A MAYOR THAT SHOULD GET MORE 
00:15:43 RECOGNITION THAT YOU GET.

00:16:03 ACCIDENT HAPPENS. 
00:16:06 AT PI POINT HOW CAN WE DEFEND THE CHICAGO TRADITION WHEREFORE YEARS

00:16:15 I FIND IT VERY ODD THAT THEY FIND A STRANGER, THEY WILL COME ACROSS 
00:16:23 SOMEBODY ACROSS SOMEBODY WHY WE SHOULD KEEP IT. 
00:16:27 I HAVE YET THIS SHOULD HAPPEN. 
00:16:29 IN FACT LAST NIGHT, I WAS TELLING MY YOGA INSTRUCTOR THAT I WAS GOING 
00:16:34 TO BE HERE. 
00:16:35 AND SHE SAID SHE HAS TO TURN THE OTHER WAY WHEN SHE COMES ACROSS. 
00:16:40 MAYOR EMANUEL, I KNOW WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT PEOPLE HERE AND AROUND THE

00:17:31 HE SAID THAT MANY YEARS AGO AND IF PEOPLE WAKE UP TODAY, HE WILL SEE 
00:17:36 THAT THINGS HAVE NOT CHANGED. 
00:17:40 WHAT HAS CHANGED, BLACK PEOPLE USED TO OWN THIS. 
00:17:45 BLACK PEOPLE USED TO WORK IN FACTORIES. 
00:17:49 BLACK PEOPLE USED TO WORK IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. 
00:17:56 DURING THAT TIME THEY DID NOT HELP ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHEN HE WAS 
00:17:59 HERE. 
00:18:03 ILLEGAL MEANS AGAINST THE LAW. 
00:18:07 SO CAPITALIST, THEY BIG. 
00:18:11 WANTING THESE ILLEGAL TO COME IN AND TO COMPETE FOR JOBS, GOODS AND 
00:18:19 CONTRACTING SERVICES THAT THE BLACK LEGAL CITIZENS ARE ENTITLED TO 
00:18:22 GET. 
00:18:24 THEY DO NOT WANT TO GO THROUGH IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION. 
00:18:30 EVEN IF YOU GO TO CHINA OR GO TO EUROPE OR ASIA, YOU CANNOT BRING A 
00:18:37 PLANT INTO THE COUNTRY WITHOUT THE AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT. 
00:18:41 YOU CAN'T DO THAT. 
00:18:44 BUT THESE PEOPLE REFUSE TO OBEY THE LAW. 
00:18:49 YOU KNOW THE BLACK COMMUNITY USED TO HAVE BUSINESS AND I'M APPALLED. 
00:19:02 RABBI IS NOW OPENING UP THE CONGREGATION AND GOING INTO A POLITICAL 
00:19:06 ARENA, IN A SYSTEM THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHECK AND BALANCE LIKE A 
00:19:12 COMMUNIST STE. ALL OF THEM ARE COMMUNISTS. 
00:19:17 HERE EVERYBODY DEMOCRAT!

00:19:38 IT'S RIGHT HERE AND BLACK PEOPLE CONTINUOUSLY, WE GOT BLACK FACE NZ 
00:19:45 HIGH PLAYSES BUT WE DON'T HAVE JOB GOODS AND CONTRACTORS. 
00:19:49 YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE WORKING IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD, WORKING IN OUR 
00:20:00 NEIGHBORHOOD AND THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE BLACK PAOE. WAKE UP! 
00:20:05 DO YOUR LIVES NOW!

00:20:56 TO SOME IT MAY SEEM LIKE A TRIVIAL OBJECTIVE. 
00:21:02 SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST DOG PARKS WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO OWNERS JUST AS 
00:21:06 MUCH AS THEIR PETS. 
00:21:09 THEY ENCOURAGE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT AND THEY MAY EVEN 
00:21:14 REDUCE CRIME IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. 
00:21:16 WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS THIS DOG PARK SINCE 2016 AND WE HOPE THAT 
00:21:20 YOU WILL HELP US WITH THAT.

00:57:52 BRINGING IT TO 535. 
00:57:53 AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE THE FAM PROGRAM THAT WORKS WITH THE YOUNG MEN.

00:58:14 AND THIS PROGRAM COMBINES INFORMED THERAPY WITH INTENSIVE AND 
00:58:19 ADVOCATE AND BEHAVIOR AND IMPROVED ACADEMIC OUTCOME.

00:59:38 MAKE ADDITIONAL YOUTH AND NEIGHBORHOOD INVESTMENT THAT CHICAGO HAVE

01:00:36 THANK YOU MR. MAYOR FOR YOUR SERVICE, YOUR ENDING YOUR TERM IN OFFICE. 
01:00:45 I KNOW WE'RE DOING OUR LAST BUDGET REVIEW, BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO THE 
01:00:48 FUTURE. 
01:00:49 THANK YOU. 
01:00:51 >> ALDERMAN ARENA? 
01:00:54 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:00:59 THIS BUDGET INCLUDES SOME THINGS THAT THIS COUNCIL PASSED AND I 
01:01:04 PERSONALLY WORKED ON. 
01:01:06 AND I WANTED TO SPEAK ON A FEW THINGS. 
01:01:10 THE OFFICE OF LABOR, IS ONE OF THE KEY THINGS THAT I SUPPORT IN THIS 
01:01:13 BUDGET. 
01:01:15 THAT'S GOING TO GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE WORKERS REALIZE 
01:01:21 THE BENEFITS OF SOME INITIATIVES THAT YOU MR. MAYOR HAVE HELPED 
01:01:25 THROUGH, THE MINIMUM WAGE, THE PAID SICK LEAVE ORDINANCE, AND 
01:01:29 HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF ALDERMAN 
01:01:36 O'CONNOR, THE FAIR WORKWEEK ORDINANCE. 
01:01:38 THESE ARE KEY MEASURES THAT OUR WORKERS NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT 
01:01:44 THEY'RE ABLE TO EARN A FAIR WAGE AND GET A FAIR WAGE. 
01:01:47 AND THIS OFFICE IS GOING TO GIVE THEM A PLACE, A CENTRAL CLEARING 
01:01:52 HOUSE TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. 
01:01:54 AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP, FOR MAKING SURE THAT 
01:02:01 THE POSITIONS WERE FUNDED THAT WERE ASKED MORE. 
01:02:03 I THINK THE LEADERSHIP OF SAM FIELDS, DESERVES TO BE RECOGNIZED THERE. 
01:02:11 C.F.O. BROWN, IN MAKING THIS HAPPEN. 
01:02:14 THE CREATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING. 
01:02:18 IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT A LOT IN THIS COUNCIL. 
01:02:22 DEFINITELY IN MY WARD ABOUT THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND AS I 
01:02:27 TALKED TO MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE CITY, THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED 
01:02:35 CHALLENGE FOR ANY ONE WARD OR ANY GEOGRAPHIC AREA. 
01:02:39 AND IT'S MY HOPE THAT AS THAT OFFICE IS ESTABLISHED, THAT WILL HELP 
01:02:44 LEAD TO THE PASSAGE OF HOST FOR ALL AND DEVELOPMENT FOR ALL ORDINANCE 
01:02:49 THAT'S ARE CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED. 
01:02:53 IT'S TIME FOR THIS COUNCIL TO GET, TO ACCEPT THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
01:02:59 IS NEEDED IN EVERY SINGLE NEIGHBORHOOD. 
01:03:03 WHAT I LEARNED IN THE CHALLENGES AROUND 5150 IS THE RESIDENTS OF MY 
01:03:11 WARD NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
01:03:14 AND THE CHALLENGES TO GETTING THE PASSAGE AS MANY OF YOU WILL HELP ME 
01:03:18 GET THAT PASSED, AND I APPRECIATE THAT. 
01:03:20 WHAT I LEARNED IS THAT PEOPLE WHO, WHO ARE PROUD ARE NOT GOING TO 
01:03:27 COME TO A MEETING WHERE PEOPLE ARE JEERING AT THEM AND DEARRIVING THE 
01:03:37 IDEA OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
01:03:39 THEY DO THAT AT WAR NIGHT, THEY DO AT THE GROCERY STORE, THEY DO THAT 
01:03:45 ON THE STREET WHEN THEY SEE ME. 
01:03:48 AND WE NEED TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF THAT. 
01:03:52 AND THIS ORDINANCE WILL HELP GET THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I BELIEVE 
01:03:57 THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING IS THE WAY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. 
01:04:02 I WANT TO, WITHIN THIS BUDGET, AND JUST YESTERDAY, I JOINED MY 
01:04:07 COLLEAGUES AT THE 16th DISTRICT WELCOMING 17 NEW OFFICERS FOR THE 
01:04:11 16th DISTRICT. 
01:04:12 AND I THINK AS WE WHAT WE HAVE DONE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, 
01:04:17 MAKE THE COMMITMENT OF HIRING THE OFFICERS, AND AGAIN, I THANK YOU 
01:04:22 MR. PRESIDENT FOR MAKING THAT COMMITMENT AND SEEING IT THROUGH. 
01:04:30 THAT EVERY DISTRICT REGARDLESS OF HOW SAFE NEEDS, OFFICERS WERE 
01:04:34 SEEING, YOUNG OFFICERS COME IN AND WE WERE GOING TO GET THEM THE 
01:04:37 TRAINING THEY NEED AND GET THEM THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO DO A GOOD 
01:04:41 JOB. 
01:04:42 AND AS WE GO INTO THE CHALLENGING TIME, THE MONEY TO DO THAT IS 
01:04:50 WITHIN THIS BUDGET. 
01:04:52 AND WITHOUT THE MONEY, IT'S JUST WORDS ON PAPER. 
01:04:56 AND I'M WEARING A BLUE RIBBON A PURPOSE MANY RIBBON, EXCUSE ME, THAT 
01:05:01 I RECEIVED AT A VIGIL LAST FRIDAY NIGHT FOR A RESIDENT OF MY WARD, 
01:05:09 HAOUDA, WHO WE LOST TO A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENT. 
01:05:15 SHE WAS SHOT AND HER HUSBAND KILLED HIMSELF IN FRONT OF HER XHIRN IN 
01:05:21 THE HEART OF JEFFERSON PARK. 
01:05:23 SHE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT. 
01:05:27 SHE HAD A COURT ORDER PROTECTION AND YET THIS PERSON WHO NEEDED 
01:05:34 MENTAL HELP, FOUND A WEAPON AND COMMITTED THIS ATROCIOUS ACT. 
01:05:55 I MET NEIGHBORS THAT GIVE HER RESOURCES TOOK HER KIDS IN, AND DESPITE 
01:06:01 THAT SUPPORT, WE STILL HAD THIS TRAGEDY. 
01:06:04 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO FUND MENTAL SERVICES FOR OUR 
01:06:13 CONSTITUENCE, AND EXTEND THAT BECAUSE THIS IS ANOTHER CRIES THAT 
01:06:15 WE'RE EXPERIENCING. 
01:06:17 IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE WITHIN THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT, WE LOST 
01:06:23 THREE OFFICERS IN THE LAST FIVE MONTHS TO SUICIDE. 
01:06:27 AND THOSE TWO INCIDENTS EXHIBIT THAT THIS IS NOT, THIS IS A HIDDEN 
01:06:31 CRISIS. 
01:06:32 IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ALLOW FOLKS TO GET OUT FROM THE 
01:06:37 SHADOWS AND WE NEED TO FUND THE RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THE RESOURCE 
01:06:41 RIGHT SIDE IN EVERY SINGLE NEIGHBORHOOD. 
01:06:44 AGAIN I WANT TO THANK BUDGET DIRECTOR FIELDS, C.F.O. BROWN, CHAIRMAN 
01:06:51 AUSTIN FOR HER LEADERSHIP THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS, TO EVERY 
01:06:55 COMMISSIONER AND THEIR STAFF FOR WORKING HARD ON THIS BUDGET AND PAST 
01:06:59 BUDGET. 
01:07:01 I STAND TODAY, I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BUDGET. 
01:07:05 I THINK WE HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF WORK TO DO, MR. MAYOR, AS I THINK YOU 
01:07:11 KNOW. 
01:07:13 BUT YOU HAVE TAKEN US A LONG WAY. 
01:07:16 I KNOW WE HAVE NOT ALWAYS AGREED BUT I VOTED FOR YOUR FIRST BUDGET

01:08:07 BEEN A REAL PLEASURE. 
01:08:13 FOR THE LAST 11 YEARS, WOULD I SAY SOME TIGHT BUDGET IN THAT TIME, 
01:08:18 SOME EASY AND SOME BAD BUT THIS ONE HAS BEEN A LIGHT LIFT FOR ME 
01:08:21 TODAY. 
01:08:23 I'M PARTICULARLY ALWAYS WANT TO GET ON BOARD WHEN WE'RE SUPPORTING 
01:08:27 OUR CHILDREN AND OUR SENIORS. 
01:08:31 SO I LIKE THIS BUDGET BECAUSE KIDS IN MY COMMUNITY ARE GOING TO BE 
01:08:35 EFFECTED AS WE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE SEND TO THE YOUTH 
01:08:41 PROGRAM. 
01:08:46 PROVIDING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM TO GET AWAY FROM SMFT VIOLENCE. 
01:08:53 TO INCREASE OUR MENTOR, TO HELP 7th GRADERS WILL BE PART OF THAT. 
01:08:58 SO MR. MAYOR, THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS 
01:09:00 BUDGET. 
01:09:01 AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND PARTNERSHIP.

01:09:45 I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT ALL OF YOU THREE HAVE DONE. 
01:09:49 >> ALDERMAN DAVID MOORE. 
01:09:51 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:09:54 I DEFINITELY WANT TO STAND AND FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
01:10:02 SERVICE AND PUTTING TOGETHER A BUDGET THAT WE CAN WORK WITH. 
01:10:07 I KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME CHALLENGES AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN 
01:10:10 STILL WORK TOGETHER TO RESOLVE THE CHALLENGES. 
01:10:13 THANK YOU FOR THE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE PUT IN PLACE REGARDLESS OF 
01:10:21 WHETHER YOU'RE WALKING OUT. 
01:10:24 THE PIEM PUT IN PLACE, I WANT THEM TO PLACE,ING NO MATTER WHAT. 
01:10:32 SAMANTHA, YOU CHOSE HER TO BE THE BUDGE DIRECTOR AND SHE DID A 
01:10:38 PHENOMENAL JOB. 
01:10:42 ALDERMAN HARRIS WOULD SAY A HERCULES JOB. 
01:10:50 I BIG SHOUT OUT TO SAMANTHA FIELD AND THAT ENTIRE TEAM. 
01:10:55 CAROL BROWN AS WE BEGIN TO WORK TOGETHER AND DEVELOP STRONGER 
01:11:04 RELATIONSHIPS, MAKING SURE WE UNDERSTANDING AND PRESENTING THE PROS

01:11:12 INSIDE. 
01:11:15 DEFINITELY WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN AUSTIN FOR LEADING THIS BUDGET 
01:11:21 PROCESS, IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY CORRALLING 50 PEOPLE, TRYING TO GET 
01:11:25 EVERYBODY'S IDEAS AND QUESTIONS, SHE DID A MARVELOUS JOB IN DOING 
01:11:31 THAT AND MANAGING THIS WHOLE BUDGET PROCESS. 
01:11:33 AND I THANK YOU AND HER TEAM FOR THAT. 
01:11:38 ALSO, LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS. 
01:11:42 THIS DOES MEATER, WITHOUT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WE CANNOT GET THE 
01:11:46 ANSWERS WE NEED TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION. 
01:11:49 UNDER MARIA AND HER TEAM, I WANT TO THANK YOU EACH AND EVERY ONE OF 
01:11:52 THEM. 
01:11:58 FOR THEIR WORK. 
01:11:59 MR. MAYOR, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DID FOR THIS BUDGET IS IS PUT 
01:12:08 FATINGER 3.4 MILLION DOLLARS FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE. 
01:12:12 THAT'S HUGE. 
01:12:14 AND I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALIZE HOW HUGE THAT IS. 
01:12:18 WHEN SOMEBODY CAN GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THEIR LIFE AROUND AND 
01:12:22 AD SOMETHING TO THEIR RESUME AND GET SOME HOPE THAT THEY NEVER HAD 
01:12:26 BEFORE, IT MEANS A LOT. 
01:12:29 AND IT BEGINS TO CHANGE NOT ONLY THAT INDIVIDUAL BUT FAMILIES, WITH 
01:12:34 CHANGE AND COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS AND HELP CHANGE OUR CITY. 
01:12:38 I COMMEND YOU ON HAVING THAT VISION TO PUT THAT THOGT. 
01:12:42 AS WE DEAL WITH WORKING WITH OUR POLICE OFFICERS WHO I TOTALLY 
01:12:51 SUPPORT. 
01:12:52 BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO GET BEHIND. 
01:12:57 AND BEEN BEHIND IT, NOT NONL WORDS BUT BY PUTING MONEY BEHIND IT. 
01:13:05 THAT SHOWS GREAT LEADERSHIP AND THENT ONE MILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT 
01:13:10 MENTORING PROGRAMS, ALWAYS HELPING OUR KIDS AND AFTER SCHOOL MATTERS 
01:13:15 AND CREATING MORE AND MORE SUMMER JOBS. 
01:13:19 THESE ARE THE THINGS, WE START HELPING THEM WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG, WE 
01:13:24 CAN STOP THE BLEEDING AND IF WE DON'T DO IT THEN, IT'S GOING TO BE A 
01:13:28 REPETITIVE CYCLE. 
01:13:30 AND I THINK MR. MAYOR, YOU SEE THAT. 
01:13:32 TODAY I THANK YOU FOR THAT. 
01:13:34 AND I'LL DEFINITELY BE SUPPORTING THIS BUDGET. 
01:13:36 THANK YOU MR. MAYOR. 
01:13:38 >> DOES THAT MEAN YOU'LL BE VOTING WITH ARENA ON THIS BUDGET? 
01:13:42 >> YES. 
01:13:46 >> OKAY, ALDERMAN OSTERMAN. 
01:13:48 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:13:52 I DO STAND IN SUPPORT. 
01:13:55 I WANT TO COMMEND ALDERMAN AUSTIN AND COMMEND SAMANTHA FIELD FOR 
01:14:03 BEING ACCESSIBLE ON QUESTIONS BROUGHT UP BY ALL OF US. 
01:14:07 THERE ARE TWO THINGS ON THIS BUDGET THAT I THINK DPOUN PAYMENTS ON 
01:14:10 THE FUTURE. 
01:14:12 AND AS ALDERMAN ARENA SAID, ONE IS THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING, WHICH 
01:14:16 WILL BE IN A TRANSITION OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. 
01:14:19 BUT PUTS A PRIORITY ON THE ISSUE OF HOUSING IN OUR CITY TO HELP US 
01:14:25 ALL DEVELOP, A SIGNIFICANT PLAN FOR HOW WE HOUSE PEOPLE IN CHICAGO. 
01:14:30 AND HOW WE HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN EVERY SINGLE NEIGHBORHOOD IN 
01:14:33 THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:14:35 IT'S AN ISSUE THAT EFFECTS US ALL. 
01:14:38 HAVING A DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO HELP US AS A CITY REALLY GET IT RIGHT. 
01:14:42 AND MAKE SURE THAT IT HELPS PEOPLE AND FAMILIES IN EVERY SINGLE 
01:14:48 COMMUNITY AND HELPS KEEP CHICAGO ANS IN CHICAGO. 
01:14:51 THE OTHER ISSUE IS A DOWN PAYMENT IN THE FUTURE AND SOMETHING WE HAVE 
01:14:55 TO CONTINUE OUR WORK ON, IS CONSENT DECREE AND REFORMS TO MAKE OUR 
01:15:00 CITIES SAFER. 
01:15:01 THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF 
01:15:04 YEARS. 
01:15:06 THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE STILL HAVE TO DO. THAT'S GOING TO BE 
01:15:10 A HEAVY LISTING, IF WE DO IT AND DO IT RIGHT, IT'S GOING TO MAKE US 
01:15:16 SAFER IN EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:15:19 FOR US, AS A CITY TO BE SAFE TRULY, IT HAS TO BE IN EVERY SINGLE 
01:15:22 COMMUNITY. 
01:15:26 DOESN'T MATTER IF MY COMMUNITY IS SAFE IF ALL THE COMMUNITIES ARE NOT 
01:15:28 SAFE. 
01:15:29 AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO WORK ON AS A BODY AND THE NEEDED 
01:15:34 REFORMS AND THE NEEDED SUPPORTS FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. 
01:15:37 BUT THE LAST THING MR. MAYOR, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INVESTMENT 
01:15:42 IN YOUTH. 
01:15:44 SINCE THE DAY YOU TOOK OFFICE, YOU HAVE MADE IT A PRIORITY TO SUPPORT 
01:15:48 YOUNG PEOPLE. 
01:15:50 AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERY KID GETS ADVANTAGES OF THESE YOUNG MEN 
01:15:56 HAD, MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE AND PROGRAMS LIKE THE BAND PROGRAM, 
01:16:01 PROGRAMS LIKE AFTER SCHOOL MATTERS AND TEEN JOBS AND MENTORING, I'VE 
01:16:06 SEEN IT WORK IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. 
01:16:08 WHERE THOSE KIDS HAVE A BETTER ADVANTAGE IN THEIR LIFE. 
01:16:11 AND YOUR FOCUS ON THAT, YOUR PRIORITY ON THAT, YOU'RE WORKING WITH 
01:16:15 ALL OF US ON THAT. 
01:16:17 YOU'RE WORKING WITH A PRIVATE SECTOR ON THAT, IS SOMETHING THAT WILL 
01:16:21 HAVE A LASTING IMPACT WITH THOSE PEOPLE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU. 
01:16:26 >> ALDERMAN PAWAR? 
01:16:28 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:16:32 I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET AND I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENT 
01:16:39 OF ALDERMAN ARENA AND ALDERMAN OSTERMAN THE TWO NEW DEPARTMENTS THAT 
01:16:47 WE'RE CREATING TODAY. 
01:16:49 FIRST THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING. 
01:16:51 YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A CRIES IN MOST MAJOR CITIES WHERE YOU HAVE A 
01:16:58 SERIES OF ISSUES COMING TOGETHER, WHETHER IT'S THE STUDENT LOAN 
01:17:02 CRISIS, THE COST OF CHILDCARE AND HOUSING AND SECURITY, ALL OF THAT 
01:17:06 COMING TOGETHER AT ONCE. 
01:17:08 AND WHILE WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
01:17:14 TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, WE'RE OFTEN BIG CITIES ON OUR OWN AND TRYING 
01:17:17 TO DEAL WITH THEM AND TRYING TO DO THE BEST WE CAN AT A LOCAL LEVEL. 
01:17:21 I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING IS THE CREATION IS A GREAT STEP IN 
01:17:26 ADDRESSING HOUSING AND SECURITY. 
01:17:28 BUT I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO, MAKE SURE THAT WE PASS AND EXPAND 
01:17:35 DEVELOPMENT, ONE THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THIS SUMMER, ABOUT EX 
01:17:40 PANEDING TODs TO HEAVILY TRAFFIC BUS LINES IN ADDITION TO RAIL STOPS. 
01:17:46 THAT WILL MAKE, LARGE AREAS OF THIS CITY, ATTRACTIVE FOR NEW INVE.. 
01:17:52 ESPECIALLY MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE DENSITY NEAR TRANSIT AND DENSITY 
01:17:59 NEAR TRANSIT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE NEAR RAIL. 
01:18:02 WE SHOULD HAVE DENSITY ON THE BUS LINES AS WELL. 
01:18:06 THE OTHER THING IS, WE CREATED A DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING WE'RE GOING TO 
01:18:13 HOPEFULLY EXPAND THE TOD ORDINANCE, BUT PART OF THE PROBLEM IN 
01:18:19 EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT. 
01:18:23 AND THNS UNIQUE TO CHICAGO, I SAY THIS AS OFTEN AS I CAN, GOOGLE 
01:18:29 AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND LOOK AT THE RESULTS THAT COME UP. 
01:18:33 WHETHER IT'S IN PORTLAND OR CHICAGO OR WASHINGTON OR NEW YORK. 
01:18:37 WE NEED 120,000 UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
01:18:42 AND ALDERMAN ARENA JUST FOUGHT TWO YEARS FOR 80. 
01:18:47 SO IF EVERY SINGLE TIME WE TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WE ALLOW 
01:18:57 PITCH FORKS TO--WE NEED TO HAVE CONVERSATION BUZZ LOCAL CONTROL WHEN 
01:19:01 IT COMES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
01:19:04 AND THEN WE HAVE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING HAVE MORE CENTRAL GOING 
01:19:07 FORWARD. 
01:19:09 LOOK, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE BAD JUST BECAUSE THEY PROTEST 
01:19:12 AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
01:19:14 I THINK A LOST PEOPLE FEEL INSECURE IN THEIR STATION ON THE ECONOMIC 
01:19:18 SPECTRUM. 
01:19:21 SO EVERYONE WANTS TO FEEL TO HANG ON TO WHAT THEY HAVE. 
01:19:24 BUT WHEN THEY HANG AON TO WHAT THEY HAVE AND TURN OTHER COMMUNITIES 
01:19:28 INTO OTHER, THAT'S A HORRIBLE MISTAKE. 
01:19:31 AND WE'VE GOT TO STOP THAT. 
01:19:32 SO I'M HOPING AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING, 
01:19:36 THAT WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION AND STOP ALLOWING OURSELVES TO GET ON 
01:19:41 THE ROAD TO SAN FRANCISCO. 
01:19:43 SAN FRANCISCO IT'S TOO LATE, THAT CITY IS GONE. 
01:19:51 YOU QUALIFY FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING IN PALO ALTO IF YOU MAKE $200,000 
01:19:56 OR LESS. 
01:19:58 WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL AND MAYBE HAVE CENTRAL PLANNING. 
01:20:03 I ALSO THI, THE CITY SHOULD BECOME A DEVELOPER AND THIS IS WHAT WE 
01:20:07 CAN DO OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING, WHILE WE CREATE A POOL, IF 
01:20:13 THE CITY BECOMES A DEVELOPER IN BUILDING NEW HOUSING, IT CHANGES THE 
01:20:17 WAY THE MARKET BEHAVES. 
01:20:19 THERE IS NO REASON THE CITY CAN JOIN VENTURES WITH DEVELOPERS, NOT TO 
01:20:25 REPLACE THEM BUT THE CITY SHOULD BECOME AN ACTIVE PARTICIPATE IN THE 
01:20:27 MARKET. 
01:20:28 THE SECOND GOING BACK TO THE OFFICE OF LABOR STANDARDS, THE CREATION 
01:20:33 OF THAT IS GREAT. 
01:20:35 AND I'M SURE KNOW, JUST FIVE YEARS AGO, PRIOR TO FIVE YEARS AGO, THE 
01:20:42 CITY OF CHICAGO HAD NEVER TAKEN A POSITION ON MAJOR LABOR. 
01:20:47 BECAUSE THERE WAS A COURT RULING AND WE HAD A DEPARTMENT OF LAW THAT 
01:20:53 WAS TWO PREVIOUS MAYORS, WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO LEGISLATE ON 
01:20:58 MINIMUM WAGE OR COMBAT WAGE STUFF. 
01:21:01 IF WE DON'T HAVE THE POWER AND IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO, WE TOOK ACTION 
01:21:09 AND PADS THE INCREASE OF MINIMUM WAGE TO GET $13 BUCKS AN HOUR. 
01:21:18 WE NOW GUARANTEE SICK TIME FOR HALF A MILLION CHICAGOIANS. 
01:21:23 SXL WITH THE CREATION OF THIS OFFICE WE CAN TAKEN FORCEMENT ACTION 
01:21:29 ONLY THE BUSINESSES WHEN THEY DON'T DO THEIR, WHEN THEY DON'T FOLLOW 
01:21:32 THE LAW. 
01:21:33 WE CAN TAKE ACTION ON WAGE STUFF. 
01:21:37 SO I THINK WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS CHOSEN TO ADVOCATE THE 
01:21:47 RESPONSIBILITY ON ACTING ON INCOME EQUALITY. 
01:21:55 THE DEPARTMENT OF OFFICE OF LABOR STANDARDS IS THE OFFICE STANDARD 
01:22:00 HAS THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE THE ACTION THAT WE TOOK OVER THE PAST FOUR 
01:22:04 YEARS. 
01:22:08 SXL FINALLY, MR. PRESIDENT, THTS LAST BUDGET I'LL GET TO VOTE ON AS 
01:22:11 ALDERMAN. 
01:22:12 WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO BEFORE MAY. 
01:22:18 IT'S BEEN A GREAT HONOR TO WORK ALONGSIDE OF YOU. 
01:22:21 AND ALSO I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU 2016, NOVEMBER OF 2016 WAS A TOUGH 
01:22:27 TIME FOR MAJOR BIG CITIES AND MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY. 
01:22:31 AND WE'VE TRIED TO GUIDE THIS SHIP IN THE CONTEXT OF PRESIDENT OF THE 
01:22:37 UNITED STATES, ATTACKING THE CITY OF CHICAGO ON A DAILY BASIS. 
01:22:43 ATTACKING US FOR BECOMING FOR BEING A WELCOMING CITY. 
01:22:47 TRYING TO PUT BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. 
01:22:53 AND I THINK AS A CITY WE'VE COME CLOSER TOGETHER, MAJOR CITIES AROUND 
01:23:03 THE COUNTRY HAVE JOINED FORCES WITH CHICAGO TO TRY TO COMBAT THE 
01:23:08 RACIST ACT OF TRUMP. 
01:23:12 IT'S BEEN AN HONOR WORKING FOR YOU. 
01:23:23 >> I WANT TO STAND--THIS BUDGET REPRESENTS SOMETHING VERY POSITIVE 
01:23:30 AND IT'S A RELIEF TO ALL OF US AS MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE 
01:23:34 RESIDENTS OF CITY OF CHICAGO BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE NO TAXES OR 
01:23:39 FEES AND THAT'S A BIG RELIEF. 
01:23:41 BUT BEING AN ALDERMAN THAT IS CONSTANTLY FACING COMPLAINTS FROM THE 
01:23:46 RESIDENTS ABOUT CITY SERVICES NOT GETTING THE ATTENTION, NOT BEING 
01:23:52 DELIVERED ON TIME, I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT, IF WE VOTE IN FAVOR 
01:23:59 OF THE 2019 BUDGET, WE HAVE TO SEE A REFLECTION OF BETTER SERVICES. 
01:24:06 SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT ON THOSE SERVICES THAT SOMETIMES, ARE NOT 
01:24:13 REFLECTED BUT ARE COMMITMENT IS. 
01:24:16 I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE VOTE FOR THIS BUDGET, IT'S NOT 
01:24:21 GOING FOB BUSINESS AS USUAL BUT IT'S GOING TO CARRY OUT SOME 
01:24:24 SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. 
01:24:26 I WANT TO ECHO WHAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID ABOUT HOUSING. 
01:24:30 BECAUSE I DO, HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THAT. 
01:24:33 AND I KNOW THAT THERE IS A BIG NEED OF MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND 
01:24:39 OTHER PROJECTS FOR PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. 
01:24:42 I WANT TO REALLY CHALLENGE THE ADMINISTRATION IS IT AON SOME SERIOUS 
01:24:52 COMMITMENT WHEN IT COMES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES 
01:24:56 FOR OUR FAMILIES. 
01:24:57 WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NEXT BUDGET ALSO, HAS A REFLECTION OF MR. 
01:25:06 OTHER NEW PROJECTS THAT ARE STILL PENDING IN THE CITY. 
01:25:09 AND I WANT TO SPEAK FOR MYSELF. 
01:25:12 I WANT THE MAYOR TO, TO ALSO REMEMBER THAT, SOME PROJECTS THAT I HAVE 
01:25:18 IN MY WARD THAT HAVE TO DO WITH HOUSING ALTERNATIVES FOR MY WORKING 
01:25:24 FAMILIES AND MY SENIORS ARE GOING TO HAVE THE BLESSING BEFORE YOUR 
01:25:31 DEPARTURE MR. MAYOR, YOU WANT TO LEAVE A GOOD LEGACY. 
01:25:34 AND THAT HAS TO XLU FAIRNESS TO ALL. 
01:25:39 FAIRNESS TO EVERY SINGLE NEIGHBORHOOD IN OUR CITY. 
01:25:41 AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN COMMITTED INTO DOING THE BEST YOU CAN 
01:25:47 TO BRING FAIRNESS AND TO BRING ALTERNATIVES FOR OUR WORKING FAMILIES. 
01:25:52 I WILL VOTE YES FOR THIS BUDGET. 
01:25:55 I WILL SUPPORT IT. 
01:25:59 BUT MR. MAYOR, I WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT NEXT YEAR, GOD WILLING 
01:26:07 I'M GOING TO BE THE SQUEAKY WHEEL TO MAKE SURE THAT SOME OF THE 
01:26:12 PROJECTS THAT ARE STILL PENDING ARE GOING TO GET FUNDED. 
01:26:17 IT'S TIME TO REALIZE THAT EVERY SINGLE NEIGHBORHOOD IN OUR CITY HAS 
01:26:21 BEEN CHANGING WITH TIME. 
01:26:22 AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PRESERVE OUR FAMILIES IN OUR 
01:26:25 COMMUNITIES. 
01:26:27 WE PRESERVE THOSE KIDS THAT GO TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS. 
01:26:31 THAT IS A FRIGHTER TO ME. 
01:26:32 AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BESIDES SERVICES, BESIDES CONTROL AND 
01:26:40 GARBAGE PICKUP OUR FAMILIES GET A FAIR SHARE WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSE 
01:26:46 ANDING OTHER ALTERNATIVE SERVICES. 
01:26:47 THANK YOU MR. MAYOR. 
01:26:56 >> ALDERMAN CAPPLEMAN. 
01:26:58 >> I TOO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET. 
01:27:01 THE THREE MILLION DOLLARS MAKEOVER WHICH HAS SPURRED A LOST ECONOMIC. 
01:27:06 WILSON AVENUE WHERE WE HAD ONE COFFEE SHOP THAT CLOSED DOWN, 
01:27:13 STARBUCKS BECAUSE OF ALL THE INDEPENDENT COFFEE SHOPS, RESTAURANTS BY 
01:27:21 ROUNTS MANY MY IMMIGRANTS OPENING UP. 
01:27:28 THE McKIN' SCHOOL GETTING A NEW GYM. 
01:27:32 25% OF THE RESIDENTS THERE, LIVE IN HOMELESSNESS. 
01:27:36 IT SPEAKS TO POWERFULLY FOR THEM THAT NOW AT LEAST SAYING THEY'RE 
01:27:40 GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET A GYM. 
01:27:44 BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HAS GONE TLUT ROOF IN THE 46th WARD 
01:27:48 AND NOW WITH THE UPTOWN THEATER, IT'S BETTER THAN THAT. 
01:27:54 I'M PLEASED, MY RESIDENTS KNOW THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE. 
01:28:00 AND THAT ALL OCCUR WITH YOU AS MAYOR. 
01:28:03 THE CITY OF CHICAGO HAS BEEN A TAIL OF TWO CITIES FOR WELL OVER A 
01:28:06 CENTURY. 
01:28:09 YOU RECOGNIZED THAT. 
01:28:10 AND MANY OF US HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT AND YOU HAVE PUT US ON THAT PATH 
01:28:14 TO ADDRESS THAT. 
01:28:16 BECAUSE AS ALDERMAN I CANNOT JUST FOIX ON BEING AN ADVOCATE FOR 
01:28:21 RESIDENT ON THE 46th WARD. 
01:28:23 TOIF ADDRESS AND ADVOCATE FOR THOSE LIVING IN POVERTY ON THE WEST 
01:28:26 SIDES OF THE CITY. 
01:28:29 IT CAN'T BE DONE OVERNIGHT, YOU KNOW THAT, I KNOW THAT. 
01:28:34 BUT WE'RE GOING FORWARD. 
01:28:35 WE'RE MOVING FORWARD. 
01:28:37 AND THAT MAKES ME SO PROUD OF THAT BUDGET. 
01:28:39 SO WITH THAT, I THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
01:28:40 THANK YOU. 
01:28:43 >> NO OTHER ALDERMAN, I'M GOING TO GO TO ALDERMAN BURKE. 
01:28:49 OKAY, ALDERMAN MOORE. 
01:28:51 >> THANK YOU MR. PR. I JUST WANTED SAY A FEW WORDS ON THE DEPARTMENT 
01:28:54 OF HOUSING. 
01:28:57 SPEAKING AS CHAIRMAN OF THE CITY COUNCIL COMMITTEE OF HOUSING AND 
01:29:00 REAL ESTATE. 
01:29:04 ALDERMAN PAWAR WAS QUIETLY INCORRECT, WE'RE NOT CREATING A NEW 
01:29:07 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING. 
01:29:09 WE'RE RECREATING A NEW DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING. 
01:29:13 BECAUSE UP UNTIL TEN YEARS AGO, THE CITY HAD A DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING. 
01:29:16 AND I THOUGHT ONE OF THE BIGGEST MISTAKES MADE BIT PREVIOUS 
01:29:23 ADMINISTRATION WAS TO ESSENTIALLY MERGE THAT DEPARTMENT INTO PLAN 
01:29:28 ANDING DEVELOPMENT. 
01:29:30 THE IMPORTANCE OF PARTICULAR RANGE OF CITY SERVICES AND CITY 
01:29:36 RESPONSIBILITY IS, IF YOU HAVE A SEPARATE DEPARTMENT WHO'S MAIN 
01:29:44 RESPONSIBILITY IS THAT NEED, FULFILLING THAT NEED AND THERE IS VERY 
01:29:48 FEW CRITICAL NEEDS, AS MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE COMMENTED THAN 
01:29:52 HOUSING. 
01:29:55 PARTICULARLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
01:29:57 IF WE ARE TO AVOID BECOME ANOTHER NEW YORK, OR SAN FRANCISCO, IF WE 
01:30:03 ARE GOING TO AVOID BECOMING A CITY THAT IS ONLY HOME TO THE VERY 
01:30:09 WEALTHY AND THE VERY POOR, THEN WE DESPERATELY NEED TO HAVE A 
01:30:16 COMPREHENSIVE AND THOUGHTFUL HOUSING POLICY. 
01:30:17 AND WE NEED TO HAVE A DEPARTMENT WHOSE SOLE FOCUS IS ON HOUSING. 
01:30:28 THAT EACH OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS IS WELCOMING TO PEOPLE FROM ALL BACK 
01:30:32 GROUNDS AND ALL INCOMES, THAT WE CAN HAVE A TRULY DIVERSE 
01:30:36 DESEGREGATED SFAOE. 
01:30:41 ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OUR CITY FACES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CRIME 
01:30:48 OR LACK OF OPPORTUNITY OR STRUGGLING SCHOOL IS SEGREGATED STATES THAT 
01:30:54 OUR NEIGHBORHOODS ARE IN AND WE NEED TO BREAK THAT. 
01:30:57 AND HOUSING IS ONE WAY TO DO THAT. 
01:30:59 AND WE HAVE MADE SOME GOOD STRIDES. 
01:31:03 WE HAVE JUST COMPLETED THE LAST FIVE-YEAR HOUSING PLAN. 
01:31:08 AND REMARKABLY ACHIEVED OUR GOALS. 
01:31:09 AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A NEW HOUSING PLAN THAT WILL 
01:31:14 BE INTRODUCED TODAY IN THE CITY COUNCIL AND WE'LL HAVE HEARINGS ON 
01:31:16 THAT. 
01:31:18 WITH THE GOAL OF MAKING SURE THAT WE GO TO THE NEXT STEP. 
01:31:23 TO ENSURE THAT OUR NEIGHBORHOODS ARE ECONOMICALLY DIVERSE AND THAT 
01:31:28 EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD HAS ITS SHARE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
01:31:33 WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY INVESTMENT FUND THAT ALLOWS DEVELOPERS TO 
01:31:38 ACCESS THE FUND AND CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN DPIF NEIGHBORHOODS. 
01:31:44 WE HAVE THE BUILDING NEED TO ALLOW PARTICULARLY IN OUR CHALLENGED 
01:31:51 NEIGHBORHOODS, PEOPLE HAVE AFFORDABLE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THAT WE CAN 
01:31:53 LIVE IN AND RAISE A FAMILY IN. 
01:31:58 AND ALDERMAN PAWAR MENTIONS THE POFRNS TRANSIT DEVELOPMENT AND 
01:32:03 EXPANDING THAT TO ENSURE THAT WE VITAL NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE HOME TO 
01:32:09 PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE. 
01:32:10 SO ONE OF THE REASONS I'M SUPPORTING THIS BUDGET IS THAT, IT DOES 
01:32:18 RECOGNIZE WHO IT'S RECREATION OF DEPARTMENT HOUSING, A DEPARTMENT OF 
01:32:22 HOUSING AND THE IMPORTANCE OF CREATING A THOUGHTFUL AND WELL FINANCED 
01:32:28 HOUSING POLICY. 
01:32:29 THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
01:32:34 >> ALDERMAN BURNETT. 
01:32:36 >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT. 
01:32:41 I ALSO LIKE TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET. 
01:32:46 I WILL BE VOTING ON IT. 
01:32:47 AND I WOULD LIKE TO DMEND THE MAYOR ON ALL THE COMMITMENTS THAT HE 
01:32:52 HAS MADE AND ALL THE SEEDS THAT HE HAS PLANTED FOR US TO BE A BETTER 
01:32:56 CITY AND BE IN A BERT POSITION. 
01:32:59 I WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND THE BUDGET DIRECTOR SAM FIELDS WHO DID A 
01:33:04 GREAT JOB AND ALSO CAROL BROWN. 
01:33:08 AND ALSO KARI AUSTIN, THESE THREE SISTERS MADE IT GOOD FOR ALL OF US. 
01:33:15 THANK YOU ALL, YOU PUT CITY IN A GOOD LIGHT FOR 2019. 
01:33:20 I LIKE TO ALSO COMMEND THE MAYOR ON DIVIDING THE DEPARTMENT OR 
01:33:29 RECREATING THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING. 
01:33:31 I THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC. 
01:33:33 A LOST THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING IN REFERENCE TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
01:33:45 THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT WHO HAVE WORKED WITH ME, THAT THE MAYOR IN 
01:33:50 THE DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN DAWN WITH MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS TO 
01:33:55 PARTICIPATE AND HELPING WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
01:33:57 THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING WILL IMPLEMENT CHICAGO'S AFFORDABLE 
01:34:02 HOUSING STRATEGIES AND XRAET LONG TERM INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK WHICH 
01:34:06 IS NEEDED AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT. 
01:34:09 ALSO IT WILL BE MORE OF A CONCENTRATION ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
01:34:17 ONE THING IS WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH, WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. 
01:34:20 ONE OF MY FIRST MEETING WITH THE MAYOR WHEN WE FIRST MET. 
01:34:26 FIRST MEETING WAS ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
01:34:28 AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, HE HAS BEEN COMMITTED IN HELPING US WITH THAT ON 
01:34:33 THOSE EFFORTS AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. 
01:34:35 YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN HELPING, I JUST DID A RIBBON CUTTING AT AN 
01:34:41 AFFORDABLE SENIOR BUILDING WITH THE MAYOR, AND THEN WENT TO THE 28th 
01:34:46 WARD AND DID ANOTHER RIBBON CUTTING WITH ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT IN THE 
01:34:50 CITY OF CHICAGO. 
01:34:51 SO WE HAVE DONE A LOT. 
01:34:54 AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE, I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THIS MAYOR, OF WHAT HE 
01:34:58 SAYS, HE WOULD DO. 
01:35:00 AND THE THINGS THAT HE HAVE DONE. 
01:35:02 I DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE. 
01:35:04 AND BECAUSE OF NOT HAVING THE CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE, I THINK ALL 
01:35:09 OF US ARE IN LIMBO WITH THE FUTURE RIGHT NOW. 
01:35:12 WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PUT POLICIES IN PLACE TO HELP PEOPLE TO HAVE 
01:35:16 AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
01:35:17 BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE GOING ON RIGHT NOW IS NOT ENOUGH. 
01:35:21 IN MY WARD, IN MY WARD AND WE VICTIMS OF OUR OWN SUCCESSES IN OUR 
01:35:24 CITY. 
01:35:26 WE'RE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THE CITY. 
01:35:30 THANK GOD THERE IS BEEN A LOT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND PUSHING 
01:35:32 SOUTH AND WEST AND NORTH AND EVERYWHERE AND RENTS ARE GOING TOUP 4 
01:35:38 DOLLARS A SQUARE FEET. 
01:35:41 THAT'S 1,000 A MONTH FOR TWO-BEDROOM A MONTH. 
01:35:46 NOT A THOUSAND, $4,000 FOR TWO-DETERMINE APARTMENT. 
01:35:52 MORTGAGES ARE GOING OVER $500 A SQUARE FEET WHICH MEANS ONE MILLION 
01:35:54 DOLLARS. 
01:35:59 SOME TO $1000 A SQUARE FOOT FOR A CON BO. WE PUCKER UP BUT WE LEAVING 
01:36:04 FOLKS BEHIND AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BALANCE IT OUT. 
01:36:08 WE TRY TO CONTINUE TO BALANCE IT OUT AND THAT'S NOT EVEN TALKING THE 
01:36:13 LOW INCOME PEOPLE, THAT CAN'T EVEN AFFORD THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHO 
01:36:19 IS BEING CHALLENGED BECAUSE, A LOST FOLKS PUSH THE AJ TO SPEND ALL 
01:36:25 THEIR MONEY AND NOW CHA RAN OUT OF MONEY AND THEY WAITING ON THE 
01:36:29 MONEY TO COME IN EVERY YEAR, BUT THE MONEY THAT COMES IN EVERY YEAR 
01:36:32 IS STILL NOT ENOUGH. 
01:36:34 THEY STILL HAVE LONG WAITING LINES WHENEVER THEY OPEN UP THE SECTION 
01:36:37 8 LIST. 
01:36:39 THAT LINE IS BLOCKS LONG. 
01:36:40 THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT COME TO ALL OF OUR OFFICES, LOOKING FOR 
01:36:45 A PLACE TO STAY. 
01:36:46 AND EVERY PLACE WE CALL TO TRY TO HELP THEM, THEY HAVE A WAITING LIST. 
01:36:51 AND IT'S SO CHALLENGING AND NOW WE, EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING UP, 
01:36:57 FEES, AND TAXES ALL OF THAT STUFF GOING UP. 
01:37:00 NOT THAT WE'RE PUTTING IT ON THIS BUDGET IT MAKES MORE INCUMBENT ON 
01:37:06 FOLKS THAT NEED A HOME. 
01:37:07 MAYOR, I WANT TO COMMEND YOU, EVERYTHING THAT I'VE WORKED WITH YOU 
01:37:12 ON, EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF A HAVING SOME, SOME FOLKS YOU KNOW, NOT 
01:37:19 LIKE WHAT I I'M DOING, YOU'RE SUPPORTING ME ON. 
01:37:22 I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. 
01:37:24 I CANNOT CRITICIZE YOU ON IT, BUT I CAN SAY THAT WE HAVE TO DO MORE 
01:37:29 FOR THE FUTURE NOT FOR TODAY BUT FOR TOMORROW CAUSE WE DON'T KNOW 
01:37:35 WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FORM AND WHERE THEIR HEART IS GOING TO BE 
01:37:38 AS FAR AS HELPING THE PEOPLE IN THE CITY BECAUSE WE KEEP RUNNING OUT 
01:37:42 OF MONEY. 
01:37:43 ALSO I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE WITH THE JOB, 
01:37:49 EXTENDER, I THINK THAT'S GREAT.

01:37:56 CITIZENS TO GET BACK INCORPORATED INTO OUR SOCIETY AND ALL OF YOU. 
01:38:01 YOU JUST DONE TREMENDOUS THINGS AND REFSHS REFERENCE TO THAT. 
01:38:04 AND ALSO ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE 
01:38:08 WORTH WHILE. 
01:38:10 AND ALSO WITH BAM, I THINK THAT'S TREMENDOUS. 
01:38:14 YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE A LEGACY, YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE A 
01:38:17 LEGACY. 
01:38:19 YOUR LEGACY IS GOING TO KHIEN. 
01:38:21 PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FEEL YOUR LEGACY AFTER YOU GONE. 
01:38:24 BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE STARTED CONTINUING 
01:38:30 ON, AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT THE CITY 
01:38:35 IN THE POSITION TO CARRY THOSE THINGS ON. 
01:38:38 I'M SUPPORTING THIS BUDGET. 
01:38:40 I'LL SUPPORT YOU MAYOR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:39:42 THROUGHOUT THE CITY AS WELL AS ADDRESSING THE HOMELESS ISSUE AND 
01:39:46 ADDITIONAL FUNDS.

01:39:54 SOLIS, WORKING TOGETHER TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE 
01:39:58 ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. 
01:40:02 AND ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AS MENTIONED BY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES, 
01:40:08 I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR NEW GOVERNOR. 
01:40:13 THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO KEEP FAMILIES LIKE IN MY COMMUNITY WHERE 
01:40:19 GENERATION HAVES LIVED, WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO LIVE. 
01:40:22 SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND I LOOK FORWARD 
01:40:26 TO WORKING WITH OUR GOVERNOR TO DO THAT. 
01:40:29 AND I WANT TO THANK YOU, MAYOR AS ALDERMAN OSTERMAN MENTIONED, YOUR 
01:40:42 PROGRAM SHOULD BE PROGRAM IS PHENOMENA AND FOR YOUR COMMIT TOMENT 
01:40:47 AFTER SCHOOL MATTERS AND THE YOUTH OF CHICAGO.

01:40:55 LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR FRIENDSHIPS. 
01:40:58 THANK YOU. 
01:41:01 >> ALDERMAN CARDENAS. 
01:41:02 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:41:06 I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON THE TEN YEARS OF MAYBESINGER YOU TOOK 
01:41:11 ON A TREMENDOUS TASK, GRUELING THE BIJT GAPS. 
01:41:20 AND YOU BROUGHT IN NUMEROUS AMOUNTS OF COMPANIES CREATING THOUSANDS 
01:41:24 OF NEW JOBS AND SETTING A NEW COURSE FOR THE CITY. 
01:41:30 AND THE WORK OBVIOUSLY, IS NOT FINISHED. 
01:41:33 BUT YOU TAOKT CITY TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL AND SOMETIMES I FELT YOU WERE 
01:41:39 WORK WITHING ONE HAND BEHIND YOUR BACK, BECAUSE THAT WHAT IT FELT 
01:41:46 LIKE WORKING WITH A GOVERNOR THAT WAS NOT WORKING WITH YOU. 
01:41:50 THE PROBLEMS AND SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE SAYING, I'M GOING TO BE A 
01:41:58 SQUEAKY WHEEL NEXT TIME, I BELIEVE THAT THE CITY IS CHANGING HAD 
01:42:02 RAPIDLY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S DISPLACING MANY OF MY 
01:42:08 CONSTITUENCE, MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS ARE FEARING WHERE ARE THEY GO TO 
01:42:12 GO AND WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO LIVE AND HOW ARE THEY GOING TO PAY FOR 
01:42:15 THE PROPERTY TAX APPROXIMATES. 
01:42:16 I TALKED TO SENIOR AND I TALK TO THEM ON THEIR WATER BILLS AND SO ON 
01:42:19 AND SO ON. 
01:42:22 THERE IS MANY SUCK SESZ, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT BUT WE ALSO HAVE MANY 
01:42:27 CHALLENGES THAT, YOU WERE TIED AND YOU COULD NOT DO SOMETHING ABOUT 
01:42:30 THAT. 
01:42:32 BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS AS A HOMEWORK. 
01:42:35 AND I USED TO DO, MANY YEARS AGO, BUDGETING IN CORPORATE, WE ALWAYS 
01:42:43 SET ASIDE, AND SAY, WHAT DID NOT WE NOT ACCOMPLISH THIS TIME AROUND. 
01:42:48 AND MANY COLLEAGUES AGREED THAT HOUSING IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL. 
01:42:52 ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE'RE CREATING NEIGHBORHOODS ENTIRELY NEW 
01:42:58 NEIGHBORHOODS, 79 ON THE NORTH SIDE AS WELL. 
01:43:00 THAT IS GOING TO BE TREMENDOUS PRICE PRESSURE ON OUR NEIGHBORHOODS 
01:43:07 WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING. 
01:43:09 WHAT WE SPEND ON HOUSING IS MINIMUM. 
01:43:12 WHAT WE SPEND ON POLICE, TAKES 30% OF OUR BUDGET AND THAT'S NOT NIF 
01:43:18 US SPECIFICALLY, BUT AS A BODY AND CITY, WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. 
01:43:22 WE HAVE TO DO BETTER IN OUR COMMUNITIES, RESPECT FOR POLICE, RESPECT 
01:43:28 FOR OURSELVES, RESPECT FOR OTHERS, RESPECT FOR PROPERTY. 
01:43:32 WE SPEND A LOT OF MONEY TAKING GRAFFITI AWAY, AND IT ALWAYS ENDS UP, 
01:43:39 TIME AND TIME AGAIN, THAT GETS REALLY TIRE SOME. 
01:43:43 WE ALL TALK ABOUT WHAT EACH OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS FACE, BUT I TELL 
01:43:48 YOU, OUR SENIORS ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION ARE GOING TO BE 
01:43:52 AT A CROSSROADS IN OUR CITY IF THEY'RE NOT ALREADY. 
01:43:55 AND THAT'S OUR TASK, NEXT TIME AND NEXT YEAR AND THE YEARS THAT 
01:43:59 FOLLOW US, IN THOSE BUDGETS THAT XLU MONEY FOR MENTAL HEALTH, MONEY 
01:44:04 FOR HOUSING AND MONEY TO HELP FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF 
01:44:07 NEW SKILLS. 
01:44:09 BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COMPETE IN A NEW ENVIRONMENT. 
01:44:13 THEY'RE NOT GOING COMPETE IN A NEW ECONOMY. 
01:44:16 AND THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR CITY. 
01:44:19 PUSHING NEW PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OUT. 
01:44:22 AND THE PEOPLE THAT CANNOT MAKE IT ARE THE ONES THAT ARE LEFT BEHIND. 
01:44:26 WE CANNOT MAKE THAT HAPPEN. 
01:44:28 WE HAVE A RESPONSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY CAN. 
01:44:31 THAT'S WHAT A HEAR FROM A LOST PEOPLE. 
01:44:34 WE'VE GOT TO MEAN IT AND WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. 
01:44:37 AND THE NEXT MAYOR THAT WANTS TO RUN FOR THIS OFFICE, THE NEXT 
01:44:42 PERSON, HAS GOT TO HAVE A PLATFORM THAT ADDRESSES EACH OF THOSE 
01:44:51 ISSUES, OTHERWISE THAINER HAVE MY SUPPORT. 
01:44:53 THE SQUEAKY WHEEL WAS THIS YEAR AND THE YEAR THAT FOLLOWS. 
01:44:57 THIS IS A BIG MAN ON CAMPUS, THE MAYOR HAS DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB OF 
01:45:02 TILTING THIS CITY, BUT THE FORCES UPON US ARE FORCES THAT WE ALL HAVE 
01:45:07 TO CONTEND WITH. 
01:45:08 WE ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER AS A BODY TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUES AND 
01:45:12 COM UP WITH SOLUTIONS, NOT JUST CRITICIZED. 
01:45:17 SO I'VE SUPPORTED THIS BIJT AS I HAVE SUPPORTED OTHER BUDGETS, TOUGH 
01:45:22 WITH PROPERTY TAXES THAT WE KNOW ARE HURTING CERTAIN POPULATIONS. 
01:45:27 BUT THEY UNDERSTAND, THEY DON'T MIND PAYING T.BUT WE HAVE TO DELIVER 
01:45:31 THE SERVICE DAY IN AND DAY OUT. 
01:45:34 THE TREE TRIRJS THE CARS, THE SIDEWALKS THE ALLEYS, THAT HAS GOT TO 
01:45:37 BE IN. 
01:45:38 AND THIS BUDGET A DRESZ IT BUT NOT ALL OF IT. 
01:45:42 THAT'S WHY WE FACE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I SUPPORT YOU MR. PRESIDENT 
01:45:45 100%. 
01:45:47 BUT WE KNOW WE HAVE OUR WORK TO DO. WE TRIED OUR BEST YOU DID A 
01:45:52 PHENOMENAL JOB, BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE NEXT YEAR.

01:45:58 >> GOOD MORNING, MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:46:00 MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL, I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET. 
01:46:04 AND AS I SIT HERE AND LISTEN TO THE SPEECHES OF MY XLAOEGZ, I REMIND 
01:46:09 MYSELF OF MY FIRST BUDGET VOTE FOUR YEARS AGO, I THINK THAT'S THE 
01:46:13 FIRST TIME I TALKED IN THIS CHAMBER. 
01:46:17 THE EASIEST BUDGET VOTE I EVER HAD TO TAKE. 
01:46:21 IT PUT US ON A PATH TO WHERE WE'RE ABLE TO STAND HERE TODAY AND BE 
01:46:27 PROUD OF WHERE OUR CITY IS GOING. 
01:46:31 ENDING THE LEGACY OF IGNORING THE ILLS IN OUR CITY.

01:46:47 THANKS TO BUDGETS LIKE THIS. 
01:46:50 AND THANKS TO A COMMITMENT A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT I DON'T THINK YOU GET

01:47:26 THINGS THAT ARE OFTEN IGNORED IN THE HEADLINES OF ACTIVIST WHO WOULD 
01:47:30 RATHER PAINT A DIFFERENT PICTURE OF OUR CITY. 
01:47:33 BUT I KNOW THAT DESPITE HEAVY LIFTING, DESPITE THE CROSS CUTTING AND 
01:47:40 THE DESPITE EFFICIENCIES WE'VE DONE, NONE THAT HAVE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
01:47:43 POSSIBLE WITHOUT YOU.

01:48:04 TEXT ROLLS, TO HELP US MOVE THE CITY FORWARD AND WORK OUR WAY OUT OF 
01:48:10 WHAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE YET TO BE 
01:48:13 ADDRESSED BY THIS COUNCIL. 
01:48:15 I UNDERSTAND MY XLAOEGZ FEAR AND FRUSTRATION FOR WHAT IS TO COM, AND 
01:48:20 PERSONALLY, I WISH WE WOULD CONTINUE OUR MARCH TOWARDS ADDRESSING THE 
01:48:27 FINANCIAL WHOAS COMING TO THE NEXT CITY COUNCIL. 
01:48:34 NO ONE SHOULD KICK THIS ANY FURTHER THAN IT NEEDS TO BE. 
01:48:37 AS I REMINDED ONE OF MY VOTERS YESTERDAY, A LOST FINANCIAL WHOAS THAT 
01:48:42 WE HAD TO ADDRESS AS ALDERMAN IN THIS TERM, STARTED BACK WHEN I WAS 
01:48:47 IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND NOBODY SHOULD LEAVE THAT TO THEIR CHILDREN OR 
01:48:51 GRANDCHILDREN.

01:48:58 DONE.

01:49:08 I WANT TO GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR A DRESSING A LOT OF THA. FOR MY 
01:49:12 COLLEAGUES FOR A DRESSING A LOT OF THAT. 
01:49:14 BUT I KNOW AS WE SIT HERE AND USE A TERM OF GREAT BUDGET CHAIRMAN, AS 
01:49:25 I STAND HERE AND FONTIFICATE ON WHAT IS COMING, IT'S INCUMBENT UPON 
01:49:29 US TO KNOW THAT THE HARD WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE, THE HARD WORK THAT 
01:49:33 WE HAVE DONE IS NOT DONE. 
01:49:35 SXL THAT WE HAVE TO FIENT ONLY FOR THE VALUES AND THE PROGRAMS OF 
01:49:41 EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE MEMBERS TALKED ABOUT AND PRAISED BUT ALSO FOR 
01:49:48 THE FINANCIAL STABILITY SO WE CAN HAVE A 21 AND 22nD CENTURY CHICAGO 
01:49:54 READY FOR THE FUTURE. 
01:49:57 THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:49:59 >> ALDERMAN DOWELL. 
01:50:01 >> YES, THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:50:04 I WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME--WE HAVE DIVIDED TO THE COMMUNITY 
01:50:12 WASHINGTON PARK. 
01:50:14 BUT I'M GOING TO SAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER DAY. 
01:50:18 I DO HOWEVER WANT TO STAND AND SAY THAT I SUPPORT THIS BUDGET. 
01:50:23 I SUPPORT THIS BUDGET FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. 
01:50:27 ONE, I HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR TAKING DOWN 
01:50:32 CONSTRUCTION IN THE CITY. 
01:50:34 FIRST WARD OUR BUILDING WILL DO THAT. 
01:50:37 A LOST THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITY WOULD NOT 
01:50:40 BE HAPPENING BECAUSE OF OUR FOCUS ON JUST THE DEEP HOLE THAT WE WERE 
01:50:48 IN. 
01:50:50 TWO, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS BUDGET IN TERMS OF VIOLENCE 
01:50:56 INTERVENTION OFFICE THAT YOU'RE PUTTING FORWARD FOR 2019, TO ELEVATE 
01:51:01 THAT ISSUE AND PUT IT AND HIGHLIGHT IT IN THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AND YOU 
01:51:05 SAID AS A WAY TO COORDINATE SERVICES WITHIN THE CITY OF CHICAGO IS 
01:51:10 SOMETHING THAT WE ALL NEED. 
01:51:12 ESPECIALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE CONTINUED WORK OF THE JUVENILE 
01:51:20 INTERVENTION SUPPORT CENTER AND THE STRONG FUTURE'S PROGRAM. 
01:51:23 IN ADDITION TO THE VIOLENCE INTERVENTION FOR THE SUM THAER YOU'RE 
01:51:25 LOOK TO GO DO AT THE GRASS ROOT LEVEL. 
01:51:29 AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE WALTER CATS FROM YOUR OFFICE WHO HAS BEEN 
01:51:36 VERY OPEN TO HEARING ITEMS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL. 
01:51:42 I WANT TO ALSO SAY THAT I SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING, THE 
01:51:48 NEWLY RECREATED DEMENT DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING. 
01:51:56 AS A COMMUNITY THAT HAS SUBSIDIZED AND AFFORDABLE. 
01:51:59 I'M HOPING THAT WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES YOU CAN DPREK AFFORDABLE 
01:52:03 HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES TO OTHER AREAS OF THE CITY THAT DO NOT HAVE ANY 
01:52:06 AT ALL OR WHO WOULD LIKE TO DO MORE. 
01:52:08 SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORK WITHING MY COLLEAGUES AND THE DEPARTMENT 
01:52:12 AROUND THAT. 
01:52:14 FINALLY I WANT TO, THANK YOU FOR ADDING RESOURCES TO THE DEPARTMENT 
01:52:20 OF STREETS OF SANITATION TO DO MORE FREE TRIMMING AND VACANT LOTS 
01:52:28 WHICH ON THE SOUTHSIDE, WE HAVE MANY THAT INCREASE IN RESOURCES IS 
01:52:34 CERTAINLY WELCOME. 
01:52:36 AND BEFORE I SIT DOWNSINGER I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN KERRY AUSTIN FOR 
01:52:45 ALWAYS TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR OUR MANY QUESTIONS TO SAMANTHA FIELDS 
01:52:53 AND HER TEAM, DAVID NELSON FOR ALL THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE AND 
01:52:59 TO ERIN KING FROM THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT FOR ALL OF HER WORK AS WELL. 
01:53:02 SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BUDGET. 
01:53:06 AND WILL BE VOTING YES. 
01:53:07 THANK YOU MR. MAYOR. 
01:53:08 >> ALDERMAN SOLIS. 
01:53:10 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:53:13 I REALLY WASN'T GOING TO SPEAK TODAY BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WAS A 
01:53:19 NO-BRAINER BUDGET BUT AS I HEAR MY COLLEAGUES SPEAK, IT REMINDS ME 
01:53:22 THAT THIS IS YOUR LAST BUDGET. 
01:53:25 AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE WHAT MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES 
01:53:29 HAVE SAID THAT, YOU HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB SINCE YOU CAME HERE IN 
01:53:34 2011. 
01:53:38 AND I HAVE BEEN LUCKY TO HAVE ONE OF THE WARDS IN SOME GREAT 
01:53:44 NEIGHBORHOODS THAT EACH ONE OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS IMPROVED UNDER 
01:53:48 YOUR TENURE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. 
01:53:51 BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK IT WAS ALDERMAN, I FORGET, I ALDERMAN 
01:53:56 SAID IT, I THINK IT WAS CAPPLEMAN, WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT BROWDER. 
01:54:08 SXL SMFT THINGS YOU HAVE DONE ARE FANTASTIC IDEAS THAT HAVE WORKED. 
01:54:14 THE CITY COLLEGES IS FRE PROGRAM THAT IS LOOKING AT THE ISSUES AND 
01:54:17 FACE OUR COMMUNITIES WITH A LONG TERM PLAN. 
01:54:19 NOT JUST TAKING CARE OF THIS ISSUE RIGHT NOW. 
01:54:23 THE BOATER EDUCATED, THE BETTER PREPARED WE HAVE OUR YOUTH, THE BERT 
01:54:29 PREPARED THEY'LL HANDLE THE CHALLENGES THAT ALL FAMILIES VL IN ANY 
01:54:33 COMMUNITY, IN ANY CITY. 
01:54:35 IF YOU TALK ABOUT EDUCATION AS A WHOLE, WHAT YOU'VE DONE AS FAR AS 
01:54:40 THE SCHOOLS, YOU NOBODISINGER I KNOW THERE WAS SOME CONTROVERSIAL 
01:54:44 ISSUE IN THE BEGINNING OF CLOSING SCHOOLS. 
01:54:46 THOSE WERE HARD DECISIONS THAT HAD TO BE MADE. 
01:54:49 BUT LET'S LOOK AT WHAT GAINS YOU'VE MADE, IN TERMS OF GRADUATION AND 
01:54:54 TERMDS OF CONGRATULATION AND YOUNG PEOPLE GOING INTO COLLEGE, THAT'S 
01:54:57 TREMENDOUS. 
01:55:00 SAFETY, I KNOW THAT LA KWAN McdONALD CASE IS NATIONAL MEDIA 
01:55:07 ATTENTION, AND THAT THAT WAS TRAGIC. 
01:55:10 WHAT WE'RE DOING IN TERMS OF THE POLICE OFFICER, HIRING NOR POLICE 
01:55:15 OFFICERS, BEING AWARE THAT WE HAVE A SAFE CITY, NOT JUST IN THE BERT 
01:55:22 NEIGHBORHOODS OF OUR CITY, THAT HAS BEEN YOUR FOCUS. 
01:55:25 I THINK THAT, I THINK WE ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THROUGH THE PRESS ABOUT 
01:55:30 THIS PILOT PROJECT THAT IS GOING TO BE INTRODUCED IN VILLAGE. 
01:55:35 LET ME TELL YOU WHY I LIKE THAT, OTHER THAN MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS 
01:55:41 REPRESENTED. 
01:55:43 WE'RE PROACTIVELY LOOKING AT THAT IN TERMS OF HOUSING AND IN TERMS OF 
01:55:45 STABILITY. 
01:55:48 LET'S LOOK AT OUR NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE 12th WARD AND THE 22 WARD AND 
01:55:54 HOW CAN THE SUCCESSES OF WARDS LIKE THE 27th WARD, 47th 25th WARD HOW 
01:56:01 CAN THE SUCCESSES IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT HELP OUT THE REST OF THE 
01:56:03 CITY. 
01:56:04 THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. 
01:56:08 AND I REALLY WANT TO SALUTE THIS IDEA OF LOOKING AT THE SOUTHWEST 
01:56:13 QUARTER OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO WHICH HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN A PORT OF 
01:56:23 ENTRY FOR SO NOW BEING LATINO AND MEXICAN COMMUNITY. 
01:56:30 MR. MAYOR, I LIKE MY XLAOEG WALTER BURNETT, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
01:56:37 FAOU. I THINK YOU SPRIEDS EVERYTHING WHEN YOU ANNOUNCED YOU WERE NOT 
01:56:42 RUNNING. 
01:56:44 I DON'T BLAME YOU, BECAUSE THIS IS A JOB THAT IS 16 HOURS A DAY AND 
01:56:50 YOU GET SMACKED IN THE MOUTH TO WAKE YOU UP. 
01:56:54 IENL SURE I COULD HAVE HANDLED IT THE WAY YOU DID AND ESPECIALLY 
01:56:58 HAVING EFFECT THE FAMILY, AS I KNOW THAT IT DID. 
01:57:01 I WAS NOT GOING SPEAK BUT I DO WANT TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY AS OTHER 
01:57:05 OF MY XLAOEGZ SAY, YOU DID A TREMENDOUS JOB. 
01:57:10 IT'S BEEN AN HONOR TO SERVE WITH YOU ON CITY COUNCIL. 
01:57:15 AND I HOPE THE BEST FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. 
01:57:21 THE CITY OF CHICAGO, IT WOULDN'T BE RECOGNIZED AS THE LEGACY YOU 
01:57:26 DESERVE UNTIL MAYBE THREE OR FOUR YEARS FROM NOW, BUT TRUST ME, 
01:57:30 YOU'LL BE RECOGNIZED. 
01:57:32 AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO BUDGET DIRECTOR CARRY AUSTIN, I DON'T 
01:57:37 THINK IF YOU KNOW, BUT I HAD SOME PERSONAL ISSUES WITH MY FAMILY AND 
01:57:42 I'VE BEEN SICK BUT I DIDN'T ATTEND ANY OF MY MEETINGS. 
01:57:47 BUT WHAT EVERYBODY SAID ABOUT YOU, IS TRUE. 
01:57:54 CAROL, SAMMY AND CARRYI E, THE THREE SISTERS TOOK CARE OF IT. 
01:58:01 >> ALDERMAN BURKE. 
01:58:03 >> MR. PRESIDENT, I JOIN WITH THE OTHER SPEAKERS TO EXPRESS SUPPORT 
01:58:09 FOR PASSAGE OF THIS 2019 BUDGET. 
01:58:16 THIS BODY HAS COME A LONG WAY OVER THE LAST 7 YEARS AND THE BUDGET 
01:58:23 REFLECTS AS IT IS CONSTITUTE. 
01:58:26 VASLY IMPROVED FINANCIAL OUTLOOK FOR CHICAGO AND THE YEARS AHEAD. 
01:58:31 ONE OF CHICAGO'S NEWSPAPERS CALLED THIS THE FEEL GOOD BUDGET. 
01:58:36 AND I BELIEVE THAT CHICAGO RESIDENTS WILL SHARE THAT SENTIMENT UPON 
01:58:44 APPROVAL BY THE CORPORATE AUTHORITIES. 
01:58:48 THIS 10.7 BILLION DOLLARS BUDGET INCLUDES NO MAJOR TAX OR FEE 
01:58:53 INCREASES, AND THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT HAS BEEN REDUCES TO 98 MILLION. 
01:59:00 THAT COMES TO GOOD NEWS TO TAXPAYERS AND REPRESENTATIVE A FAR CRY 
01:59:07 FROM 436 MILLION DOLLARS SHORTFALL IN 2011. 
01:59:13 THE 2019 BUDGET REENFORCES AND BUILDS ON PUBLIC SAFETY REFORM, EXPAND 
01:59:22 JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUMMER PROGRAMS, AND A MENTORING INITIATIVE FOR 
01:59:27 AT-RISK YOUNG PEOPLE THAT HAVE CURVED GANG VIOLENCE NEIGHBORHOOD 
01:59:33 BENEFITING ALL CHICAGO RESIDENTS. 
01:59:38 THE BUDGET PROVIDES ADDITIONAL RESOURCE FOR POLICE TRAINING AND 
01:59:41 REFORM INITIATIVES AIMED AT ELEVATING THE TRUST THAT WAS NECESSARY IN 
01:59:43 THE COMMUNITY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
01:59:46 IT INCLUDES COST SAVING MEASURES, LIKE TO RELATE THE REPLACEMENT OF 
01:59:52 SODIUM LABS TO MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT LED LIGHTS. 
01:59:57 MR. PRESIDENT AS SO MANY OF THE PRIOR SPEAKERS HAVE SAID, THIS WILL 
02:00:02 BE YOUR FINAL BUDGET. 
02:00:04 WE ALL COMMEND YOU FOR CONFRONTING A SERIOUS FINANCIAL CRISIS AT THE 
02:00:10 ONSET OF YOUR FIRST TERM. 
02:00:13 AND MAKING HARD DECISIONS, SOME OF THEM PAINFUL AND UNPOPULAR. 
02:00:19 BUT IN DEED PRACTICAL AND NECESSARY TO RESTORE EQUALIB R*I UM. 
02:00:37 AND AS MANY HAVE ADDRESSED, IT TAKES TIME, IT TAKES PATIENCE AND END 
02:00:41 RESOLVE. 
02:00:43 MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE DONE THE HEAVY LIFTING AND BUILT A SECURITY 
02:00:49 FOUNDATION. 
02:00:51 AND I WOULD ALSO AD THAT UNDER YOUR ADMINISTRATION, THAT GLASS 
02:01:01 CEILING THAT SOME PEOPLE REFER TO HAS BEEN SHATTERED. 
02:01:07 AND AS I SIT HERE AND REFLECT ON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE ARCHITECTS OF 
02:01:14 THIS 2019 PLAN, I THINK ABOUT CAROL BROWNSINGER I THINK ABOUT ERIN 
02:01:19 KING, ABOUT SAM FIELDS, I THINK ABOUT CARRY AUSTIN, ANA VALENCIA AND 
02:01:30 MR. PRESIDENT YOU TRULY ASSEMBLED A REMARKABLE TEAM OF SMART AND HARD 
02:01:36 WORKING WOMEN. 
02:01:40 I ALSO JOIN WITH THE PRIOR SPEAKERS IN EXTENDING OUR APPRECIATION FOR 
02:01:48 YOU MR. PRESIDENT, FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN SEVEN EVENTFUL YEARS BUT 
02:01:55 THERE IS MORE TO BE DONE. 
02:01:56 AND I KNOW THAT YOU ARE RELISHING THESE COMING MONTHS OF 2019 TO MAKE 
02:02:06 SURE THAT YOU'RE IMPACT AND YOUR LEGACY WILL NOT SOON BE FORGOTTEN. 
02:02:15 AND I ALSO THINK THAT, AS WE PUT THIS TO A VOTE AS CHAIRMAN AUSTIN 
02:02:22 WILL ASK THE NEXT FEW MINUTES, THAT IT MAY BE GOOD TO THINK ABOUT THE 
02:02:32 BIBLICAL PARABLE OF THE LOST SHEEP. 
02:02:38 IN THE BIBLE, THERE IS A PARABLE THAT INCLUDES THESE WORDS, WHAT MAN 
02:02:52 MONG YOU HAVING 100 SHEEP AND LOSING ONE, WOULD NOT LEAVE THE 99 IN 
02:02:57 THE DESSERT AND GO AFTER THE LOST ONE NEL FINDS IT. 
02:03:02 AND WHEN HE DOES FIND IT, HE SETS IT ON HIS SHOULDERS WITH GREAT JOY 
02:03:07 AND UPON HIS ARRIVAL HOME, HE CALLS TOGETHER HIS FRIENDS AND 
02:03:10 NEIGHBORS AND SAYS TO THEM, REJOICE WITH ME BECAUSE I LOST MY LOST 
02:03:14 SHEEP. 
02:03:16 MR. PRESIDENT, YOU MAY HAVE FOUND SMFT MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL. 
02:03:20 IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO BE REJOICING AT A UNANIMOUS VOTE. 
02:03:34 ISN'T THAT A GREAT WAY TO MARK YOUR LAST BUDGET. 
02:03:44 CONGRATULATIONS, PLEASE JOIN IN GIVING THIS MAYOR A UNANIMOUS VOTE. 
02:03:51 AS THIS MAYOR CAN PUT ON HIS SHOULDER AND BRING YOU BACK. 
02:03:56 THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:03:59 >> THANK YOU FOR THAT OLD TESTAMENT. 
02:04:05 CHAIRMAN AUSTIN? 
02:04:07 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT.

02:05:12 WE HAD A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT, YOU SET THE CITY UPRIGHT. 
02:05:20 WE'RE NOW HEADED TOWARDS FISCAL YEARS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL BE 
02:05:27 BENEFICIAL TO ITS CITIZENS.

02:05:35 HONOR TO HAVE SERVED AS YOUR BUDGET CHAIRMAN FOR THESE 8 YEARS.

02:11:56 I NOW MOVE TO THE RETURN TO THE REGULAR ORDER OF BUSINESS. 
02:11:59 >> BEFORE WE RETURN TO THE REGULAR ORDER OF BUSINESS, I WOULD LIKE TO 
02:12:04 ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL. 
02:12:06 IT HAS BEEN NOTED THAT THIS WAS MY LAST BUDGET. 
02:12:11 AND I THINK ABOUT THIS AND WHEN WE PASSED OUR FIRST BUDGET SEVEN 
02:12:15 YEARS AGO. 
02:12:17 THE CITY OF CHICAGO WAS APPROACHING A FISCAL CLIFF, MANY OF YOU HAVE 
02:12:20 NOTED. 
02:12:21 AND TODAY WE CAN SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THAT THE CHICAGO IS BACK ON 
02:12:27 SOLID GROUND. 
02:12:55 SAME TEAMS OF WIND YOUNG AND OTHER PLAYERS, IT'S RIGHT WHEN WE MAKE 
02:12:59 OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS SERVICES. 
02:13:01 IT'S RIGHT WHEN WE ALSO INVEST IN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY ADDING MEN AND 
02:13:06 WOMEN TO POLICE DEPARTMENT BUT GIVING THEM A TRAINING SO THAT 
02:13:10 PROFESSIONAL AND PROACTIVE. 
02:13:15 SO SOME MAY SPRIEB IT AS EASY OR NO-BRAINER, BECAUSE OF THOSE 
02:13:21 REASONS, THERE IS A LOT OF RIGHT HERE. 
02:13:24 OUR WORK IS NOT DONE BUT GIVEN WHERE WE ARE SEVEN YEARS A THE 
02:13:29 FINANCIAL DRAIN ON THE CITY, WE CAN SAY WITH CONFIDENCE WE'RE BACK ON 
02:13:32 SOLID GROUND. 
02:13:33 AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL OF YOU. 
02:13:36 EVERYONE OF YOU. 
02:13:38 FOR SHOWING THE COURAGE, THE STRENGTH AND DETERMINATION TO ADDRESS 
02:13:43 OUR CITY'S CHALLENGES OVER THE ART OF THE LAST EIGHT YEARS IN EACH 
02:13:48 CONSECUTIVE BUDGET. 
02:13:50 AND WITH EACH BUDGET WE HAVE REFUSED TO ALLOW THE CITY'S PAST 
02:13:55 MISTAKES TO ROB US OF THE FUTURE WE WERE TRYING TO BUILT. 
02:14:00 WE REJEKTD THE OLD WAYS OF DOING BUSINESS, WHERE PROBLEMS WERE 
02:14:03 AVOIDED. 
02:14:06 RATHER THAN CONFRONTED HEAD ON. 
02:14:08 WE HAVE REPLACED INSTABILITY WITH STABILITY, WISHFUL THINKING WITH 
02:14:16 HONEST ECONOMY AND BROENG BUDGETS WITH HONEST BIJTS. 
02:14:20 WITH 8 CONSECUTIVE BUDGETS IN A ROW, WE HAVE NOT REFRAINED FROM 
02:14:26 INVESTMENT. 
02:14:27 THIS BUILDS ON THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE BUILT TOGETHER. 
02:14:31 WITH THIS BUDGET WE'LL CONTINUE TO BRING OUR DEFICIT DOWN, IT IS NOW 
02:14:36 LOWER THAN IT'S BEEN IN OVER A DECADE. 
02:14:39 WITH THIS BIJT IT ALLOWS US TO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO CONTRIBUTE FOR 
02:14:44 NOT JUST UNDER THE RAINY DAY FUND BUT MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN OUR 
02:14:49 CHILDREN'S FUTURE, IN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND MORE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD 
02:14:55 SERVICES THAT OUR RESIDENTS HAVE DONE. 
02:14:57 AND WE HAVE DONE THAT WITH NO NEW TAXES, THAT'S BECAUSE PRIOR BUDGETS 
02:15:03 DID MUCH OF THE HARD WORK FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB CREATION. 
02:15:08 AS I SAID WHEN I FIRST PRESENTED THIS BUDGET, I'VE BEEN IN LINE FOR A 
02:15:12 VERY LONG TIME. 
02:15:14 AND ONE THING I'VE LEARNED THROUGH MY TEN YEAR, IS NOBODY GETS A 
02:15:20 STATUE FOR RESTORING FISCAL STABILITY. 
02:15:22 WHILE WE DID NOT CREATE THE FISCAL CHALLENGES, YOU STEPPED UP TO 
02:15:26 ADDRESS THEM. 
02:15:29 AND LET ME BE CLEAR ALSO BEEN SAID, OUR WORK IS NOT DONE. 
02:15:33 IN THE NEXT CITY COUNCIL WHEN WE ALL MEET, I PLAN ON LAYING OUT WHAT 
02:15:38 I THINK NECESSARY STEPS BUILDING ON OUR PRIOR 7 YEARS OF ADDRESSING 
02:15:43 OUR PENSION. 
02:15:44 THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF OPERATING ANNUAL BUDGET AND WE CAN SAY WITH 
02:15:50 CONFIDENCE, IT IS STABLE, STRONGER AND GIVES US THE FLEXIBLE TO DO 
02:15:56 THE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR YEARS. 
02:16:03 UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT IN OUR KIDS, PROGRAM, SIRM JOCKS, INCREATION 
02:16:06 THE SIZE OF OUR POLICE FORCE BY NEARLY A 1,000 SXUN PRECEDENTED 
02:16:11 INVESTMENT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD SERVICES THAT MAKE LIVABILITY, 
02:16:16 RELIABILITY OF OUR NEIGHBORS ESSENTIAL. 
02:16:19 AND UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
02:16:21 SO WHEN WE SEE THE TYPE OF GROWTH WE'RE SEEING THROUGHOUT THE CITY OF 
02:16:26 CHICAGO, WE WANT EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD TO BE PART OF THAT AND EVERY 
02:16:32 RESIDENT. 
02:16:33 WE'RE NOT WHERE WE NEED TO BE BUT ON THE PATH OF WHERE WE NEED TO GO. 
02:16:38 AND I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE NOTION OF ECONOMIC GROWTH. 
02:16:43 IT MAY NOT BE ON THIS BUDGET. 
02:16:45 ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IS NOW NOT ONLY HAVE A AN EDUCATION 
02:16:51 SYSTEM THAT GIVES OUR CHILDREN THE FUNDAMENTALS. 
02:16:56 KIDS ARE DROPPING OUT OF COLLEGE IN FOURTH GRADE, THAT MEANS BY FOUR 
02:17:00 YEARS OLD THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE FUNDAMENTALS. 
02:17:04 WE'RE ON THE COURSE NOW OF FREE UNIVERSAL FREE K FOR EVERY CHILD IN 
02:17:11 THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
02:17:12 OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS, WE HAVE ADDED FOUR ADDITIONAL YEARS OF 
02:17:15 EDUCATION. 
02:17:17 BUT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN, GO ON PAST 
02:17:24 HIGH SCHOOL ON TO WHETHER IT'S COLLEGE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND 
02:17:28 ARMED FORCES. 
02:17:30 THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM, WE HAVE NOW MADE IT FREE FOR 
02:17:35 OUR CHILDREN AND ONLY PUBLIC SCHOLARSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES THAT A 
02:17:42 SOMEBODY CAN GET TO BECOME PASTER AMERICAN DREAM, WE DON'T WANT MAKE 
02:17:47 SURE THAT AT ANY TIMES A BURDEN ON THEIR FAMILY TO GIVE THAT 
02:17:50 EDUCATION. 
02:17:52 WITH THIS BIJT MAKES A DOWN PAYMENT AND CONTINUES DOWN THE PATH THAT 
02:17:58 WE STARTED 8 YEARS AGO. 
02:17:59 OUR WORK IS NOT DONE BUT WE HAVE A FOUNDATION TODAY TO WORK OFF OF. 
02:18:04 I WILL COME BACK, AND LAYOUT WHAT I THINK THE NEXT STEPS FOR BUILDING 
02:18:09 ON THE LAST 7 YEARS AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO, THE PENSION OF MEN AND 
02:18:16 WOMEN THAT ARE DEDICATED TO PUBLIC SERVICE HERE IN CHICAGO, FROM OUR 
02:18:21 POLICE AND LABORS AND MUNICIPAL. 
02:18:23 IT HAS TO BE SAID, OVER THE LAST 8 YEARS, COLLECTIVELY, NOT BEEN A 
02:18:30 STRAIGHT LINE BUT WE HAVE MASTERED AND MUSTERED TO BRING CHICAGO BACK. 
02:18:39 WE HAVE TAING THE TOUGH VOTES AND MATED SMART CHOICES AND MADE OUR 
02:18:44 CITY STRONGER FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. 
02:18:46 THIS BUDGET IS ANOTHER STEP IN THAT JOURNEY OF PROGRESS AND BECAUSE 
02:18:51 WE HAVE CHOSEN THE PATH OF PHYSICAL RESPONSIBILITY OVER POLITICAL 
02:18:59 EXPEDIENT SIGH AND CONFRONTING OUR CHALLENGES, I'M MORE CONFIDENT 
02:19:03 THAN EVER, THAT CHICAGO BEST DAYS ARE STILL TO COME. 
02:19:07 THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL OF YOU. 
02:19:08 [APPLAUSE] 
02:19:15 >> THANK YOU.

02:39:52 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:39:54 >> ALDERMAN BURKE. 
02:39:57 >> I WOULD LIKE TO JOIN WITH THE CHAIRMAN AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF 
02:40:03 THE BODY WHO HAVE SPOKEN IN FAVOR OF THIS SPLENDID APPOINTMENT. 
02:40:17 THAT HEARING COMMISSIONER FORD'S APPOINTMENT THAT I HAD THE PRIVILEGE 
02:40:21 OF SERVING FOR MANY YEARS AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ON POLICE 
02:40:27 AND FIRE WOULD HEAR APPOINTMENTS OF THE COMMISSIONERS OVER THE YEARS. 
02:40:43 AND HIS APPOINTMENT IS HIGHEST TRADITIONS OF THAT LONG LIST OF 
02:40:48 COMMISSIONERS WHO HAVE LEAD THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IN THE NATION WITH 
02:41:00 THE DISTINCTION AND TALENT. 
02:41:02 THE HISTORY OF CHICAGO FIRE DEPARTMENT IS SO INCLINED WITH THE 
02:41:07 HISTORY OF CHICAGO THAT IT'S HARD NOT TO MENTION THAT ONE OF THOSE 
02:41:16 FOUR STARS, ON THE CHICAGO FLAG REPRESENTS THE GREAT CHICAGO FIRE 
02:41:27 1871, WHEN THE BLUDGEONING FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS PUT TO THE ULTIMATE 
02:41:35 TEST. 
02:41:37 IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT IN 1903, THE CHICAGO FIRE DEPARTMENT BATTLES 
02:41:46 VAINLY THE RESCUE PEOPLE FROM THE THEATER FIRE. 
02:41:56 BUT OUT OF THAT TRAGEDY 603 PEOPLE WERE KILLED. 
02:42:02 THERE CAME A CHANGE IN BUILDING CODES ALL AROUND THE WORLD WHEN THE 
02:42:10 VICTIMS OF THE THEATER FIRE, ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE THE FLAMES, THEY 
02:42:16 WERE UNABLE TO GET OUT. 
02:42:18 AND THEY PILED UP BEFORE THE DOORS, BECAUSE AT THAT TIME, DOORS TO 
02:42:26 MAJOR GATHERING PLACES ARENA,S THEATERS, WHATEVER, OPENED INWARD. 
02:42:34 SO WHEN THE VICTIMS RUSHED TO THE DOOR, THEY WERE UNABLE TO FLEE THE 
02:42:42 FIRE AND PROBABLY THE REASON THAT SO MANY, 600 SOULS DIED. 
02:42:51 AND IN FACT, WHEN YOU LEAVE THIS BUILDING TODAY, I URGE YOU GO OUT IN 
02:42:58 THE DOOR AND STOP FOR A MINUTE AND LOOK AT THE CAP ON THE NORTH SIDE 
02:43:08 OF THE--THAT WAS CREATED TO COMMEMORATE THE VICTIMS OF THAT TRAGIC 
02:43:18 FIRE. 
02:43:22 THAT SAW THE GREAT LOSS OF FIGHT ON THAT TERRIBLE DAY IN DECEMBER OF 
02:43:31 1903. 
02:43:33 SO DOWN THROUGH THE YEARS, THE FIRE DPEPT HAS BEEN LEAD BY WHOLE LINE 
02:43:47 OF BRAVE AND COURAGEOUS TALENTED PEOPLE. 
02:43:54 AND THIS IS NO EXCEPTION. 
02:44:01 THIS APPOINTMENT REFLECTS THE SUCCESS THAT COMMISSIONER HAS ENJOYED 
02:44:09 IN HIS ENTIRE 35-YEAR CAREER. 
02:44:13 HIS RECORDS SPEAKS FOR ITSELF AS, WE SAY IN THE LAW, LOCAL COURT. 
02:44:20 THE THING SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. 
02:44:25 AND WHILE I CONGRATULATE YOU MR. PRESIDENT ON THIS WISE CHOICE, I 
02:44:31 THINK IT ALSO PAYS TRIBUTE TO THE THIRD TERMINATION AND DEDICATION OF 
02:44:38 ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. 
02:44:40 ALL THE WOMEN AND MEN WHO EACH AND EVERY DAY RUSH TO THE JAWS OF 
02:44:49 DEATH TO RESCUE AND SAVE THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS. 
02:44:52 IT SHOWS THAT THERE IS A GREAT POOL OF COUNT HERE IN CHICAGO FIRE 
02:44:58 DEPARTMENT. 
02:45:02 THE FINEST FIRE DEPARTMENT IN THE NATION, IN THE CITY, THAT BE ALWAYS 
02:45:10 REFER TO AS THE MOST AMERICAN OF AMERICAN CITIES.
