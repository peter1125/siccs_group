00:02:03 RECITED BY ALDERMAN TULLY TULLY.

00:02:18 STATES OF AMERICA AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT

00:02:20 JUSTICE FOR ALL ". 
00:02:21 >> THE INVOCATION WILL BE DELIVERED. PLEASE REMAIN 
00:02:28 STANDING. 
00:02:29 >> LET US PRAY, IN THE CHRISTIAN TRADITION WE REMEMBER 
00:02:33 THAT WE JUST CELEBRATED, PEN. WHEN JESUS WAS SENT TO 
00:02:48 THE PUBLIC SQUARE. SO WE PRAY THAT THAT SAME WISDOM AND 
00:02:53 PASSION FALLS HERE TODAY. WHO ARE GIVEN THE 
00:02:57 RESPONSIBILITY AND JOY OF CARING FOR THE CITY. WE PRAY 
00:03:01 FOR THE BE LOVED CITY TO BE A CHICAGO FOR ALL. THAT IT 
00:03:07 WILL BE A PLACE OF HEALTH SAFETY AND ECONOMIC 
00:03:11 OPPORTUNITY. THAT IT WILL BE A PLACE OF SAFE AND REFUGE 
00:03:19 PARTICULARLY FOR THE WEAK. AND THAT OUR IDENTITIES TO 
00:03:24 BE CELEBRATED AS A STRENGTH AND NOT FEARED. BLESS THOSE 
00:03:29 WHO ARE GATHERED HERE WITH WISDOM AND GRACE, AS THEY 
00:03:34 SEEM TO CARE HERE IN WISDOM AND GRACE. I INVITE YOU TO 
00:03:42 SAY A MEN. AMEN. 
00:04:39 >> IN THE LAST MONTH, YOU HAVE BEEN BLAMING THE POLICE 
00:04:46 DEPARTMENT. YOU THEN DECIDED TO REPEAT THE RUMOR THAT 
00:04:52 THE F O P IS TO IGNORE THE CRIME. THAT'S SOMETHING 
00:04:56 THAT'S NOT RIGHT TO UTTER TO THE CITY. THE F O P IS NOT 
00:05:01 TO DO OR DO ANYTHING. THEY SEE THE WRITING ON THE WALL. 
00:05:05 SPEAKING OF CRIMINALS, STOP BLAMING THE POLICE, EVERY 
00:05:10 SINGLE MORNING. START BLAMING THE CRIMINALS, THAT ARE 
00:05:14 DOING THE WRONG. THE JUDGES THAT REFUSE TO HOLD THE 
00:05:24 REPEAT OFFENDERS IN JAIL. IF YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK TOE 
00:05:47 PLACE TO BLAME START LOOKING AT THE BEGINNING. THEY 
00:05:51 CONSTANTLY LOOK THE OTHER WAY WHILE BAD BEHAVIOR SNOW 
00:05:55 BALLS INTO BAD BEHAVIOR. A SCHOOL SYSTEM WITH SOCIAL 
00:06:00 JUSTICE AND VICTIM HOOD. THE SAME COMMUNITY OF CERTAIN 
00:06:05 VOICES, IMAGINE HOW MUCH WORSE THE POLICE WILL DO IF 
00:06:09 THEY DO LESS. I ASSURE YOU THAT THERE'S SEVERAL POLICE 
00:06:13 DEPARTMENTS THAT WILL LOVE THE MAN POWER, BECAUSE THEY 
00:06:17 HAPPEN TO HAVE LOWER CALLS FOR SERVICE. I DON'T KNOW -- 
00:06:24 WHY DOES ALL OF THIS MATTER? REAL SIMPLY, I'LL CUT TO 
00:06:29 THE CHASE, BECAUSE, MEN AND WOMEN LIKE OFFICER BRIAN, S 
00:06:34 T R O U.S. E. HE GAVE HIS LAST BREATH FROM THIS VERY 
00:06:41 CITY, DEFENDING IT FROM THESE CRIMINALS -- 
00:07:19 >> HEY, CUT IT ACCIDENT I NEED SOMETHING TO SAY, I 
00:07:24 NEED TO TELL YOU THIS FROM EXPERIENCE. WE TOOK A 
00:07:28 BUILDING OFF DEMO LIST. ARE ARE 
00:09:59 >> LET US GET A WAIVER SO TO GET SOME MONEY, SO WE CAN 
00:10:04 PAY INTO THE UNION. 
00:10:21 >> MY NAME IS, PATRICK. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT YOUR 
00:10:25 BETTER TOGETHER TRANSITION TEAM THAT YOU PUT TOGETHER ON 
00:10:29 APRIL 9TH AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AND CITY EXPERTS 
00:10:34 RESIDENTS. YOU WENT AROUND TO PUT TOGETHER CHICAGO A 
00:10:39 BETTER PLACE TO LIVE. YOUR MODELLING ADMINISTRATION IS 
00:10:43 BASED ON TRANSPARENCY. YOUR VALUES WERE EQUITY AND 
00:10:50 TRANSPARENCY, AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND INCLUSION. WHAT 
00:10:54 YOU FAILED TO DO IS YOU FAILED TO TAKE AND ASK THE F O P 
00:11:00 FOR OUR INPUT. THAT'S WHAT YOU FAILED TO DO. YOU ARE 
00:11:04 LOOKING AT THE OBJECTIONS FOR THE ACCOUNTABLE TO REDUCE 
00:11:10 GUNS AND PRIORITY AND REFORM THE C P D. MAYOR, I WORKED 
00:11:16 THIS JOB FOR 30 YEARS, I KNOW WHAT'S WRONG AND THE 
00:11:21 REFORM THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE BY THIS DEPARTMENT. TO 
00:11:24 MAKE THIS DEPARTMENT MUCH MUCH BETTER, AND ONE THING TO 
00:11:27 DO IS MORAL, THAT'S ONE THING THAT IT WILL DO. IN 1985 
00:11:34 I TOOK THE TEST TO BECOME A CHICAGO POLICE OFFICER, 
00:11:40 THERE WERE 40 THOUSAND PEOPLE TO TAKE THE EXAMINATION. 
00:11:44 THE REASON WHY WE CAN'T GET THEM TO TAKE THE TEST IS 
00:11:48 THAT THIS JOB IS BECOMING MORE DIFFICULT. POLICE 
00:11:52 OFFICERS ARE GETTING MURDERED ON A DAILY BASES. MAYOR, 
00:11:56 IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT MOVING CHICAGO FORWARD, YOU MUST 
00:12:02 GET INPUT FROM EVERYONE, THAT INCLUDES F O P. YOU WILL 
00:12:06 HAVE DIFFICULTY ACHIEVING YOUR GOAL IF YOU DO NOT 
00:12:11 INCLUDE US IN THE MEMBER SUPPORT. FALSE RUMORS ARE 
00:12:16 SPREAD. THE GENERALLY ELECTION COMMUNICATION CAN BE ON 
00:12:21 BOTH SIDES, BUT YOU MUST BE ABLE TO RESPECT EACH OTHER. 
00:12:25 I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW. WE WILL BE WILLING TO MEET 
00:12:28 WITH YOU AND ANY OTHER ALDERMAN AT ANY TIME. 
00:12:34 >> MR. MURRAY, ANY TIME THAT THE F O P WANTS TO DO 
00:12:39 ANYTHING OTHER THAN OBSTRUCT AND OBJECT AND REFORM, I'VE 
00:12:43 BEEN MORE THAN WILLING TO OBJECT WITH YOU. 
00:12:46 >> APPLAUSE. 
00:12:48 >> MAYOR, I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND ARGUE WITH 
00:12:52 YOU. I WORKED IN INGLEWOOD, AND I WORKED 8 YEARS FOR 
00:12:58 THE CITY COUNSEL. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT I'M AN HONEST 
00:13:03 GUY, I'LL SIT DOWN AND TALK TO YOU. IF YOU WANT TO SIT 
00:13:06 THERE AND TALK TO US, I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM. 
00:13:09 >> ANY TIME YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD IN REFORM, AND NOT 
00:13:15 BLOCK EVERY SINGLE ISSUE, AND CRITICIZE AND SAID NO. MY 
00:13:21 DOOR IS OPEN, I SAID THAT TO YOUR PRESIDENT, AND NOBODY 
00:13:25 HAS TAKEN ME UP ON THAT. 
00:13:29 >> THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MR. GEORGE BLAKEMORE. 
00:13:33 >> GOOD MORNING MR. BLAKEMORE. 
00:13:36 >> GOOD MORNING TO YOU. 
00:13:40 >> I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE [INAUDIBLE] ESPECIALLY

00:14:18 BUSINESSMAN. SO I'M THANKING YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU 
00:14:28 AGAIN, SOME OF YOUR APPOINTEES WASN'T ELATED ABOUT IT. 
00:15:00 WATCH THEM, WATCH THEM VERY CROSSLY, DO NOT LET THEM

00:15:10 THESE BLACK GHETTOS. WE WANT TO BRING ECONOMIC 
00:15:14 DEVELOPMENT TO THESE BLACK GHETTOS, WE DON'T WANT ALL OF 
00:15:20 THE WEALTH TO BE IN BRANDON RILEY'S WARD. INSTEAD OF 
00:15:32 DOING [INAUDIBLE], AND NOT GETTING ANY GOOD SERVICE AND 
00:15:35 CONTRACTS AND JOBS. MADAM, YOU LISTEN TO THE PUBLIC,

00:18:19 >> IT'S MS. ISRAEL. NEXT SPEAKER IS MR. BISHOP GREG G 
00:18:30 R E E R. 
00:18:31 >> BISHOP GREG. G R E E R. TODAY I'M ASKING FOR THE 
00:18:51 RESIGNATION OF ALLEGED E D B E R G: THE QUESTION IS, 
00:18:58 DID, ALDERMAN GO AGAINST HIS POSITION BY BUYING STUFF 
00:19:08 USING CITY FUNDS, WAS THAT A FRONT HIS PERSONAL AGENDA 
00:19:12 TO COLLECT GUNS? DID ALDERMAN ED *BERG ABUSE HIS CITY'S 
00:19:24 OFFICE BY HOLDING GUNS IN HERE? . HOW MANY BUY BACK 
00:19:32 GUNS WERE TRANSFERRED TO ALDERMAN'S COLLECTION, WITHOUT 
00:19:37 GOING THROUGH THE BACKTRACK N C S PROCESS? WE'RE SAYING 
00:19:41 TODAY THAT WE WOULD ASK THE ALLEGEDER MAN DIRECTLY FOR 
00:19:46 HIS RESIGNATION. ONCE THAT IS DONE THEN CHICAGO CAN 
00:19:52 CLOSE HIS DARK CHAPTER IN ITS HISTORY THAT IS OFTEN 
00:19:59 SEPARATE. AND I HAVE TO REMIND THE ALDERMAN ALLEGED THE 
00:20:08 HELL THAT YOU GAVE WASHINGTON. WE'RE ASKING FOR THE

00:20:21 RIGHT THING AND REDESIGN. 
00:20:22 >> THANK YOU. 
00:20:24 >> THANK YOU, SIR. 
00:20:25 >> THANK YOU, BISHOP GREEN. 
00:20:30 >> *K A L E I A JOHNSON. 
00:20:34 >> GOOD MORNING. 
00:20:35 >> THANK YOU. DURING THE TALK WITH THE PRESS, OF THE 
00:20:40 TWO TRILLION DOLLAR -- RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION THAT READ, 
00:20:46 35 MILLION DOLLAR SPENT, 675 DAYS, 5 HUNDRED PLUS 
00:20:53 WITNESSES, AND 18 ANGRY DEMOCRATS, NO, CONCLUSION OR NO 
00:21:06 RESTORATION, AND NO ACCUSATIONS OR, IMPEACHMENTS. WHILE 
00:21:17 TAGGING HIS CREDIBILITY OF KNOWN CREDIBILITY EVIDENCE. 
00:21:22 WHICH HURTS IN THE EYES OF THE PUBLIC. OUR SYSTEM SAYS 
00:21:25 THAT YOU'RE INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY, NOT THE OTHER 
00:21:30 WAY AROUND. THE PRESIDENT CLEARLY DID NOT COMMIT A 
00:21:33 CRIME, WE WOULD HAVE SAID SO, WE DID NOT HAVE 
00:21:38 DETERMINATION. HOWEVER THE SPECIAL COUNSEL SAID THAT 
00:21:42 THE EVIDENCE WAS QUOTE ON QUOTE INSUFFICIENT THAT POINTS 
00:21:46 TO A NON GUILTY VERDICT. IF YOU THOUGHT THAT DONALD 
00:21:52 TRUMP WAS INNOCENT THEY WOULD HAVE SAID SO, ALTHOUGH, 
00:21:55 THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO CHARGE HIM. HOW CAN 
00:21:58 YOU MOVE ON TO, IMPEACHMENT WITHOUT EVIDENCE. ARTICLE 
00:22:10 TWO, SAYS CRIMES OF ROBBERY ACCIDENT OR HIGH CRIMES OF 
00:22:15 MISDEMEANORS, IT ALL HAPPENS WITH THE WHY HOUSE -- WITH 
00:22:20 THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND TRIED IN THE SENATE, 
00:22:23 ANY OFFICIAL CONVICTED BY THE SENATE IS IMMEDIATELY 
00:22:28 REMOVED BY THE OFFICE. AND IMPEACHMENT HAS TO PASS FROM 
00:22:32 BOTH THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE. BECAUSE HE HAVEN'T BEEN 
00:22:36 PROVEN IN ANY WRONG DOING NOT IN OFFICE, NOT BEFORE. 
00:22:40 AND IN OUR COURT SYSTEM, IF THE JUDGE DETERMINES THAT 
00:22:44 THE ACCUSED IS WEAK, HE CAN THROW THE CASE OUT AND DROP 
00:22:48 THE CHARGES, THE BURDEN OF PROOF LIES WHERE THEY CAN SIT 
00:22:53 BACK AND WATCH THE CASE. HE HAS GIVEN HOPE IN AMERICA. 
00:23:12 YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TAKE THAT HOPE AND DREAM AWAY FROM 
00:23:16 -- THE PRESIDENT WILL NOT BE IMPEACHED. AND HE WILL 
00:23:20 FINISH HIS TIME IN OFFICE AND HE WILL FINISH STRONG AND 
00:23:25 BE REELECTED. 
00:23:26 >> THANK YOU, MS. JOHNSON. 
00:23:28 >> THE NEXT SPEAKER IS Z A K I A:

00:24:43 WELL, THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TWO ADMINISTRATIONS AGO. UNDER 
00:24:47 DAILY, AND R O M N Y MANUAL, THEY SAT ON MILLIONS OF C H 
00:24:53 A MONEY, AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS SUFFERING FROM LACK 
00:24:57 OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. PLEASE, MAYOR, AND I WISH NOBODY 
00:25:03 WOULD TALK TO HER GEORGE WHILE I'M TRYING TO PLEAD MY 
00:25:09 CASE, FOR NEEDING BLACK PEOPLE ON THE WEST AND THE SOUTH 
00:25:13 SIDE OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO, MAYOR, THIS IS URGENT.

00:26:39 >> THANK YOU, THE NEXT SPEAKER, IS MR. DAN, H U L.A. H 
00:26:45 A N. 
00:26:46 >> GOOD MORNING, MAYOR LIGHTFOOT. FIRST I WANT TO 
00:26:55 ADDRESS CITY COUNSEL MY FATHER PASSED AWAY IN SAINT 
00:27:02 PATRICK'S DAY, HE WAS THE CHIEF IN 2008. AND ALLEGED HE 
00:27:11 DO *BERG, TOOK A QUIET TIME, AND I WANT TO SAY THANK 
00:27:15 YOU, FOR YOUR FAMILY. SECOND WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS, I 
00:27:18 WAS TAUGHT TO LOOK OUT FOR MY NEIGHBORS TO LOOK OUT FOR 
00:27:23 PEOPLE, AND BE THERE WHEN THEY NEED YOU. I WAS IN ED 
00:27:38 BURKE'S PRESENCE. AND I WAS WORKING AT, M A K O R M I K 
00:27:47 PLACE. I TOLD HIM, I WAS NOT GOING TO DO IT. THE GUY 
00:27:52 ATTACKED ME, I HAD TO TAKE HIM OUT. HELPED HIM GET ON 
00:27:59 THE HOSPITAL. HE TESTIFIED TO THE POLICE THAT HE HIT ME 
00:28:05 FIRST, AND IT TURNS OUT THAT IT WAS, A RELATIVE FROM MR. 
00:28:11 ROBERT [INAUDIBLE] WHEN THEY CAME BUSTING DOWN OUR DOOR, 
00:28:18 AND THEY SAID, WE HAVE TO CHARGE YOU WITH SOMETHING, TWO 
00:28:29 ASSAULTS WHERE I HAVE TO PAY, 5 HUNDRED DOLLARS TO PAY 
00:28:35 MY BAIL. TWO CHICAGO POLICE OFFICERS TESTIFIED. HE 
00:28:39 TOLD ME HE HAD ANAL ENTERCATION WITH DAN H U L L.A. H A 
00:28:46 N. HE TURNED AROUND, AND WE SUBDUED HIM DURING THE 
00:28:54 STRUGGLE, I WAS CONVICTED AND SENTENCED, AFTER, 6 
00:28:59 MONTHS, I WAS ATTACKED. THEY TRIED TO KILL ME, I SPENT 
00:29:05 6 MONTHS IN CLINIC. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS THAT THEY 
00:29:17 HAVE TO PROVE THAT THESE CONVICTIONS WERE LIED. THEY 
00:29:21 STOLE MY INHERITANCE THAT MY FATHER LEFT TO ME, AND I 
00:29:27 WENT TO ED *BERGS FOR HELP, I ALSO GAVE HIM ALL OF THE 
00:29:35 INFORMATION ABOUT THE WRONGFUL CONVICTION, MR. ED *BERG, 
00:29:41 WAS INTERESTED TO PUT A LETTER TO CARRY MY NAME BUT NOT 
00:29:53 TO STRAIGHTEN OUT HIS POLICE WARD. 
00:29:59 >> GOOD MORNING, SIR. 
00:30:04 >> GOOD MORNING, I SEE YOU UP THERE, IT'S LIKE A 
00:30:08 REMOVAL OF A BLACK CLOUD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE 
00:30:11 BEFORE YOU GOT HERE, I WATCHED YOU STANDING IN THE RAIN, 
00:30:17 THANK YOU AGAIN, AND WE LOOK FORWARD. WE HAVE TO LOOK 
00:30:24 AT THE P L.A.'S, IF WE TALK ABOUT THE REFORM, WHERE'S 
00:30:28 THE BENEFIT COMMITTEE AGREEMENTS? WE HAVE THE NEW 
00:30:32 CONTRACTORS OUT, OUTSIDE OF C H A, WE DON'T HAVE A PLACE 
00:30:36 AS CONTRACTORS AND DEVELOPERS IN OUR OWN NEIGHBORS, WE 
00:30:42 HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WAY THAT THEY LOOK BUSINESS, DON'T 
00:30:45 NO ONE THAT THIS CHAMBER WANTS TO DO IS TOUCH ANYTHING 
00:30:51 FROM THE UNION. WE HOPE THAT YOU'RE COURSE AGE US AND 
00:30:54 THAT YOU WILL HELP FACILITATE AND HOW THEY DO BUSINESS. 
00:31:00 THE C H H PROGRAM OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, THEY 
00:31:03 DEVELOPED TWO HUNDRED CONTRACTORS, YOU DON'T SEE THAT 
00:31:07 ANYWHERE. WE HAVE TO PROMOTE THAT, WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY 
00:31:10 SUPPORT FROM ALDERMAN. THE UNIONS TRIED TO UNDER MINE 
00:31:16 IT. I HAVE BEEN UNDER MINED AND KICKED OUT OF PROJECTS 
00:31:20 ACCIDENT I CANNOT GO OUTSIDE OF THE PROBLEM. I HAVE 
00:31:23 TRAINED AND DEVELOPED OVER ONE HUNDRED MEN AFTER, 15 
00:31:28 MONTHS, WE'RE NON UNION SHARP, WHERE THE NON UNION HAVE 
00:31:36 THE RIGHT TO WORK. JANICE VERSUS, A L D E R M A N. 
00:31:45 GIVE US THE RIGHT TO WORK WITHOUT UNION IF WE CHOOSE TO. 
00:31:49 WE'RE NOT ANTI UNION, BUT WE'RE NOT UNION BECAUSE OF THE 
00:31:54 WAY THAT THEY ARE DOING THE BUSINESS OVER THE YEARS, 
00:31:57 WHERE'S THE BUSINESS WHEN IT COMES TO VIOLENCE, THEY 
00:32:01 EXAMINE TORT AND TAKE OUR MONEY, THEY ARE BREAKING OUR 
00:32:05 STATE. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE F O P WHY IS IT THAT A 
00:32:11 POLICE OFFICER CAN SHOOT A POLICE OFFICER DOWN AND GET 
00:32:14 AWAY WITH IT. NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE TOUGH, BUT IT'S HOW 
00:32:21 POWERFUL F O T IS. THEY CONTROL OUR BUDGET, THEY 
00:32:25 CONTROL OUR CITY, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WAY THAT THEY 
00:32:29 DO BUSINESS, OR THE CITY WILL CONTINUE TO CRUMBLE 
00:32:32 ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. THEY 
00:32:37 CANNOT CONTINUE TO DIG TAIT WHERE THE DOLLARS GO. WE 
00:32:41 HAVE TO HAVE A REAL CONVERSATION AND WE CANNOT GIVE INTO 
00:32:44 ANYTHING THAT THEY PUT ON THE TABLE. WE CANNOT DO THAT. 
00:32:48 WE'RE NOT GOING TO SURVIVE. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A JOB 
00:32:52 AS MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR COMMUNITY. BUT IT TAKES MORE 
00:32:56 THAN US, OUR LEADERSHIP, WHERE'S OUR LEADERSHIP WHEN IT 
00:33:00 COMES TO THE REAL ECONOMICS, HOW DO WE HELP OUR CITY? I 
00:33:05 HAVE BEEN LOCKED OUT OF MY WARD. (SPEAKING AWAY FROM 
00:33:11 MIC). 
00:33:12 >> THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MR. L.A. M O N T. BURNETT. 
00:33:21 >> I LIVE IN UPTOWN FOR 13 YEARS AND CHICAGO FOR MY 
00:33:46 WHOLE TIME. I WENT TO THE HOTEL BECAUSE IT WAS 
00:33:51 AFFORDABLE FOR ME. I WAS PAYING, 344 DOLLARS FOR AN S R 
00:33:57 O AND A SHARED BATHROOM FOR 75 MEN. THAT WAS LESS THAN 
00:34:02 25 PERCENT MEDIAN INCOME OR A M I. AND A DEVELOPER WHO 
00:34:10 BOUGHT MY BUILDING WANTED TO PUSH US OUT. WHEN I 
00:34:16 LOOKED, THERE WERE NO APARTMENTS, IT WAS ONLY AFTER A 
00:34:19 YEAR FIGHTING THAT WE WON A SETTLEMENT THAT PARTIALLY 
00:34:26 SUBSIDIZED MY RENT. AND AN ADDITIONAL 120 DOLLARS PER 
00:34:32 MONTH. THE DEVELOPMENT WOULD CREATE AN ORDINANCE 
00:34:37 AFFORDABLE TO ME, AND 25 PERCENT OF THE A M I. UP TO 60 
00:34:47 PERCENT. THAT IS MORE THAN ALL OF MY CURRENT INCOME, 
00:34:52 I'M NOT ALONE ON THIS. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN 
00:34:55 COMMUNITY SURVEY IN 2016, 60 THOUSAND HOUSEHOLD ON THE 
00:35:04 NORTH SIDE, AND ALL OF THE RENTERS IN COOK COUNTY, MADE, 
00:35:09 LESS THAN 30 THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR, I HAD TO LIVE 
00:35:12 SOMEWHERE, RIGHT NOW FINDING AN APARTMENT, IS LIKE
