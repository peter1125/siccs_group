00:10:30 THESE PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO OVERWORK IN UNDER WATER HORSES AND WORK 
00:10:36 THEM IN EXTREME TEMPERATURES. 
00:10:37 THESE ARE THE BULLIES WHO TRY TO INTIMIDATE THOSE WHO SIMPLY WANT 
00:10:43 THOSE WITHOUT A VOICE PROTECTED. 
00:10:48 CAA VOLUNTEERS ALWAYS REMAIN PROFESSIONAL AND WE DOCUMENT WHEN 
00:10:53 CHICAGO LAW IS BEING BROKEN. 
00:10:59 I'M PROUD THAT YOU'RE AN ALLIANCE FOR ANIMALS. 
00:11:02 CAA FOR SHORT. 
00:11:04 WAS FOUNDED WITH THE MISSION TO MAKE CHICAGO A KINDER CITY FOR ALL, 
00:11:10 COMPASSION TOWARDS ANIMALS DOES NOT MEAN NOT HAVING ANY EMPATHY FOR 
00:11:14 OTHERS. 
00:11:15 IN FACT THEY'RE CLOSELY RELATED. 
00:11:19 THE ORDINANCE, NOT TO RENEW HORSE CARRIAGE LICENSES WERE INTRODUCED 
00:11:23 ALMOST A YEAR AGO. 
00:11:25 HOWEVER, WHEN IT WAS FINALLY HEARD AND THE COUNCIL IN THE COMMITTEE 
00:11:31 UNLICENSED AND CONSUMER PROTECTION, THE VOTE WAS BLOCKED.

00:12:10 >> THANK YOU. 
00:12:13 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS PAULO. 
00:12:21 >> GOOD MORNING. 
00:12:24 MY NAME IS PAULA ROUTSON AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT ORDINANCE 2017898 TO 
00:12:36 END HORSE CARRIAGE IN CHICAGO. 
00:12:37 THIS BILL IS SITTING IN THE LICENSE COMMITTEE AND REALLY DESERVES A 
00:12:40 VOTE. 
00:12:43 I'M ASKING ALDERMAN TO BLEWS DON'T LET THIS GO ANOTHER YEAR. 
00:12:47 ABOUT FIVE MONTHS AGO, I MOVED ACROSS THE STREET FROM A CARRIAGE 
00:12:50 COMPANY AND BECAME AWARE WHEN THE HORSED STARTED AND ENDED WORK. 
00:12:57 AND AT TIMES IN 90- WEATHER. 
00:12:59 I STARTED DOCUMENTING WHAT I SAW. 
00:13:03 JUNE TO AUGUST, I DOCUMENTED TEN INSTANCES OF HORSES BEING OUT IN 
00:13:13 90-DEGREE WEATHER. 
00:13:25 BEING A HORSE WORKED TWICE THAT IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE. 
00:13:28 CLEARLY FOLLOWING THE LAW IS NOT A CONCERN FOR THE HORSE COMPANIES IN 
00:13:31 CHICAGO. 
00:13:35 I'VE WITNESSED DRIVERS PARKING AND CARRIAGES WALKING AWAY LEAVING THE 
00:13:41 HORSE ALONE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. 
00:13:43 RUSH STREET IS A PARTY STREET LINED WITH MANY RESTAURANTS AND BARS, 
00:13:47 PEOPLE FILL THE SIDEWALKS AND STREET CAFES, WEEK ENTITLESED OF LARGE 
00:13:53 CROWDS OF PEOPLE OUT DRINKING IS NO PLACE FOR HORSE CARRIAGE TO 
00:13:55 TRAVEL THROUGH. 
00:13:58 YET WE SEE THE CARRIAGE DRIVERS DO JUST THAT, ANOTHER DANGEROUS 
00:14:01 VIOLATION OF THE LAW. 
00:14:06 THE MOST COMMON VIOLATION IS WORKING PAST THE SIX-HOUR LIMIT. 
00:14:11 IT'S RARE TO SEE A DRIVER FOLLOW THAT RULE. 
00:14:15 WE'RE HOLD BY THE CARRIAGE DRIVERS THAT THE DRAFT HORSE THAT'S ARE 
00:14:20 BRED INTO THIS INDUSTRY LIKE WORKING, I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT A HORSE 
00:14:25 WANTS TO WALK AROUND THE BUSY WATER DISTRICT FOR 12 HOURS, TETHERED 
00:14:33 WITH BLINDERS MANEUVERING THROUGH BUS SXZ GARBAGE TRUCKS AND LOUD 
00:14:40 MOTORCYCLES AND AMBULANCES AND FAST-MOVING CARS. 
00:14:42 SEPTEMBER FIRST OF THIS YEAR, VOLUNTEERS FROM CHICAGO ALLIANCE FOR 
00:14:47 ANNALS WITNESSED TEN HORSES OVERWORKED ON THAT SATURDAY. 
00:14:51 FROM SEPTEMBER TO OCTOBER, I'VE WITNESSED NUMEROUS DRIVERS WORKING 
00:14:55 HORSES 10 TO 13 HOURS AT A TIME. 
00:14:59 ON OCTOBER OF 13 THIS YEAR, I WITNESSED AND DOMENTZ A CARRIAGE DRIVER 
00:15:03 ARRIVING ATWATER TOWER PLACE AT NOON AND RETURNING TO THE STABLES 
00:15:08 JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT. 
00:15:10 THAT'S ALMOST 13 HOURS IF YOU AD TRAVEL TIME FROM STABLE TO TACK LINE. 
00:15:15 THIS IS NO WAY TO TREAT AN ANIMAL. 
00:15:23 I ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS, WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK OUT. 
00:15:25 PLEASE GIVE THIS A VOTE. 
00:15:27 >> THANK YOU, THE NEXT SPEAKER IS CHRISTINE KENNEL.

00:16:09 THERE WERE 234 OF THEM AND THERE WERE ALSO APPROXIMATELY 20,000 IN 
00:16:15 FINES THAT WERE ISSUED AGAINST THE CARRIAGE COMPANY. 
00:16:18 OF THOSE VIOLATIONS, THERE WERE THAT'S PROBABLY AT A FRACTION OF 
00:16:22 VIOLATION THAT'S WERE REPORTED BY OUR VOLUNTEERS. 
00:16:29 UNFORTUNATELY, JUST THE 234 WERE ISSUED. 
00:16:32 OUR ISSUES IS THAT CRUELTY KEEPS HAPPENING TO THESE ANIMALS DUE TO 
00:16:35 WHAT WAS ALREADY MENTIONED. 
00:16:38 WAS THAT THE ANIMALS ARE ONLY SUPPOSE TO WORK SIX HOURS.

00:17:15 I JUST HEARD SOMEBODY SAY, PEOPLE WORK LONGER.

00:18:27 TURN OUT WHERE THEY'RE ABLE TO RELAX IN A LARGE ENCLOSURE WHERE THEY

00:22:20 PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE AND DIRECTER OF LAYOLA COMMUNITY CENTER. 
00:22:24 I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATION 
00:22:31 THAT WOULD PROTECT AND SUPPORT SENIOR NEEDS. 
00:22:35 ON TUESDAY JUNE 15, 2017, I WAS CALLED TO A HEALTH SITUATION AT A 
00:22:41 HOLLYWOOD HOUSE A SENIOR BUILDING. 
00:22:43 THE AIR CONDITIONING IN THE BUILDING HAD NOT BEEN WORKING FOR SEVERAL 
00:22:49 CONSECUTIVE DAYS WHEN OUTDOOR TEMPERATURES WERE GREATER THAN 90 
00:22:52 DEGREES. 
00:22:58 THERE WERE 12 FLOORS. 
00:23:00 I BROUGHT SIX NEWSINGER STUD SXENTS THEIR INSTRUCTOR WITH ME THAT DAY 
00:23:03 AND WE WENT DOOR TO DOOR STARTING ON THE 12th FLOOR. 
00:23:08 WHERE WE FOUND ROOM TEMPERATURES, REACHING 89 TO 93 . 
00:23:15 ACCORDING TO THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC GUIDELINES, ROOM 
00:23:18 TEMPERATURE IN THE SUMMER SHOULD BE MAINTAINED BETWEEN 73 AND 79 . 
00:23:25 WE KNEW WE NEEDED MORE SUPPORT TO REACH ALL THE RESIDENTS IN THE 
00:23:29 BUILDING IN A TIMELY MANNER. 
00:23:30 SO I REACHED OUT TO ALDERMAN OL'ED STERMAN'S OFFICE AND HE SENT A 
00:23:39 TEAM OF CHICAGO FIREFIGHTERS AND PARAMEDICS TO HELP US ASSESS ALL THE 
00:23:42 RESIDENT. 
00:23:44 ON THAT DAY, THERE WERE THREE RESIDENTS SENT TO THE HOSPITAL AND 
00:23:48 DOZENS MORE THAT WERE ESCORTED TO COOLING AREAS FOR THEIR SAFETY. 
00:23:57 THE ORGANIZATION THAT OWNS HOLLYWOOD HOUSE, DIDN'T HAVE TO DO 
00:24:00 ANYTHING BECAUSE THE CITY OF CHICAGO, THERE IS NO MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE 
00:24:04 REQUIREMENT. 
00:24:06 THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW OLDER ADULTS HAVE BEEN KEPT AT THE MARGINS 
00:24:12 TIME AND TIME AGAIN. 
00:24:15 I'M HERE TO SAY, WE NEED TO CHANGE THIS. WE NEED A SENIOR PLATFORM 
00:24:22 THAT WILL ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND MORE BY PASSING THE RECREATION 
00:24:27 PLAN, UNLD THE HOUSING DEPARTMENT AND PASSING A SENIOR HOUSING BILL 
00:24:31 OF RIGHTS.

00:26:46 THEY CAME AND CHECKED BUT REFUSED TO LEAVE THEM IN A FUNCTION WAY. 
00:26:53 THEY DID NOT ASK WE WANTED THEM TO AD SOUND TO THE PULL CORDS AND TO 
00:27:03 BRIT PULL CORDS SO THE ATTENDANT AT THE DESK CAN HEAR THE SOUND 
00:27:08 WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT. 
00:27:09 THE WAY THEY HAD THE PULL CORDS AND THE EMERGENCY LIGHTS, THEY HAD 
00:27:14 THEM ABOVE THE DESK AND THE ATTENDANT AT THE DESK WAS FACING AWAY 
00:27:21 FROM THE PULL CORDS AND THEY HAD NO SOUND. 
00:27:25 AFTER MILLDRED PASSED AWAY THEY WERE FORCE TODAY PUT SOUND AND CHANGE 
00:27:31 THE WAY THE PULL CORD WERE PUT IN. 
00:27:41 SO THIS IS WHY WE NEED A SENIOR CAMPAIGN RENOVATION AND RELOCATION

00:30:51 >> THANK YOU. 
00:30:54 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS FRANK HILL. 
00:31:09 >> GOOD MORNING. 
00:31:11 MY NAME IS FRANK HILL. 
00:31:14 I'M A BOARD MEMBER OF JAIM ADAMS SENIOR CAUCUS AND A RESIDENT OF CH A 
00:31:20 SENIOR BUILDING IN EDGEWATER. 
00:31:22 I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE CHICAGO RELOCATION PLAN 
00:31:29 ORDINANCE THAT IS BEING INTRODUCED TODAY. 
00:31:34 MY BUILDING IS ONE OF MANY SENIOR BUILDINGS THAT THEY HAVE RENOVATED 
00:31:39 THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. 
00:31:41 WHEN MY BUILDING WAS RENOVATED IT FELT THAT WE WERE HE VIKTD. 
00:31:46 THEY TOLD US THAT THEY HAD 30 DAYS TO FIND A NEW APARTMENT. 
00:31:51 THAT CAUSED CHAOS AND PEOPLE HAD TO GET OUT IN THEIR WALKERS AND 
00:32:00 WHEELCHAIRS AND FIND ANOTHER CHA UNIT WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM CHA. 
00:32:07 WINTER TIME GAME AND ONE SIDE OF THE BUILDING WAS OUT OF HEAT. 
00:32:12 AFTER RESIDENTS COMPLAINED, THEY MOVED IN HEATERS BUT RESIDENTS HAD 
00:32:20 TO TAKE ALL THE COSTS. 
00:32:21 I WAS MOVED TO A REHAB APARTMENT IN THE BUILDING WHERE THE HEAT 
00:32:26 DIDN'T WORK EITHER. 
00:32:27 I WAS TOLD THAT THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY NEEDED THE SPACE HEATERS 
00:32:32 BACK AND THEY WERE TAKEN AWAY TO BE LOCKED IN THE CLOSET WHILE ALL 
00:32:38 THE STAFF WENT OUT ON HOLIDAY VACATION. 
00:32:40 I WAS FREEZING. 
00:32:44 THE WORSE PART OF THAT OF ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE GONE WRONG AND THE 
00:32:48 ATROCITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING IN OUR BUILDING, JUST CONTINUE 
00:32:52 DOWN THE ROAD TO HAPPEN IN OTHER SENIOR BUILDINGS. 
00:32:56 WE WENT TO CHA TO TELL THEM WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND NOTHING WAS 
00:33:00 CORRECTED. 
00:33:04 AFTER MY BUILDING WAS RENOVATED, OTHER BUILDINGS WERE RENOVATED. 
00:33:12 GRAB BARS WERE REMOVED AND DID NOT REPLACE THEM PUTING SENIOR'S LIVES 
00:33:16 IN JEOPARDY. 
00:33:20 THIS IS WHY JANE SEYMOUR CAUCUS HAVE WRITTEN THE RELOCATION PLAN 
00:33:27 ORDINANCE WHICH WILL BE INTRODUCED BEFORE THE CITY COUNCIL TODAY BY 
00:33:30 ALDERMAN OSTERMAN. 
00:33:33 THIS ORDINANCE WILL MAKE SURE THAT DEVELOPERS HAVE A TRANSPARENT PLAN 
00:33:37 IN PLACE THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF RESIDENTS 
00:33:42 DURING A RELOCATION AND THAT THERE WOULD BE OVERSIGHT AND 
00:33:48 CONSEQUENCES IF RESIDENTS ARE NOT TREATED SAFELY. 
00:33:57 WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY THE HIGHEST PRICE, OUR LIVES, SO THAT 
00:34:05 CONTRACTORS CUT CORNERS. 
00:34:08 I'M ASKING ALL ALDERMAN -- 
00:34:09 ~>> THANK YOU. 
00:34:11 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS PATRICK McWILLIAMS. 
00:34:33 >> MY NAME IS PATRICK McWILLIAMS AND I'M WITH LET OUT CHICAGO. 
00:34:39 FOR SOME MONTHS WE'VE BEEN DOING EDUCATION, WRITING ARTICLES DEMOS 
00:34:44 TRAITING ALL THROUGHOUT THE CITY ABOUT THE DANGER AND LEAD AND 
00:34:48 SERVICE LIVES HERE IN CHICAGO. 
00:34:49 THE DANGER IF ANYONE DOES NOT KNOW, 70% OF HOMES, TESTED HAVE BEEN 
00:34:55 POSITIVE FOR LEAD AND ONE-THIRD OF THOSE HAVE LEVELS ABOVE EPA 
00:35:02 STANDARD. 
00:35:04 THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD ESPECIALLY TO THE MOST VULNERABLE. 
00:35:10 FOR YEARS THE CITY HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. 
00:35:15 POISONED BY OUR WATER THIS WAS CONFIRMED IN 2018 BUT THE ONLY 
00:35:20 RESPONSE HAS BEEN TO DENY ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PROBLEM AND 
00:35:28 ATTEMPT TO SWEEP IT UNDER THE RUGS. 
00:35:31 THE MOST IN ANY CITY IN COUNTRY. 
00:35:34 IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH CRIESES OF STAGGERING PROPORTION THAT'S HAS 
00:35:39 BEGUN TO GET CONSEQUENCE SXZ WILL ONLY GET WORSE UNLESS DECISIVE 
00:35:43 ACTION IS TAING SOON. 
00:35:47 STRIKINGLY ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN CHILDREN OF WEST 
00:35:52 SIDE, NEIGHBORS ALREADY SUFFERING UNDER OCCUPATION BY THE CPD IN A 
00:35:58 COMPLETE LACK OF ECONOMIC INVESTMENT. 
00:36:01 AND WHY DOES CHICAGO HAVE SO MANY LEAD SERVICE LINES? 
00:36:06 IDEAL 1996, YOU COULD NOT HAVE A LEAD PIPE EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO. 
00:36:11 AND NOW SAYING THAT THE LINES ARE NOT THE CITY'S PROBLEM, AT ANY 
00:36:16 TIMES A GROSS DENIAL OF THE HISTORY BUT A TOTAL ADDOCATION OF THIS 
00:36:23 CITY TO THE CITIZENS OF CHICAGO. 
00:36:26 AND I UNDERSTAND THERE IS REAL ESTATE TAX TO TRY TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE. 
00:36:30 AND I'M HAPPY TO SEE ANY MOVE, BUT WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR THAT EVEN THIS 
00:36:35 MEASURE IS STILL AS IT STANDS, TOTALLY INADEQUATE TO THE TASK AT HAND. 
00:36:42 THIS IS ONE OF THE RICHEST CITY IN THE WORLD, NOT ALONE THE NATION. 
00:36:46 WE HAVE 95 MILLION FOR A NEW COP ACADEMY. 
00:36:53 WE'RE WILLING TO HANDLE TWO MILLION TO AM SONL BUT WHEN IT COMES TO 
00:36:59 PROVIDING BASIC SEFSHSZ, CLEAN DRINKING WATER, WE'RE NOT ABLE TO COME 
00:37:01 UP WITH THE FUNDS. 
00:37:02 I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW IS CRIMINAL. 
00:37:04 I THINK THE MAYOR, AND THE CITY AND LEADS THIS ENTIRE CITY COUNCIL IS 
00:37:10 CULPABLE FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. 
00:37:13 WHOLE COMMUNITIES ARE BEING SACK FRIEDS FOR THE SAKE OF RICH 
00:37:16 CORPORATIONS SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO LIFE UNTIL EVERY LEAD PIPE 
00:37:23 IS REPLACED, SCHOOL SCHOOLS AND PLAYGROUND RIGHT SIDE FREE OF 
00:37:31 ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS AND UNTIL THIS CITY GIVES RESTITUTION TO THOSE 
00:37:34 EFFECTED. 
00:37:36 WE DESERVE CLEAN WATER. 
00:37:38 >> THANK YOU, THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JACKIE PAGE. 
00:37:48 >> GOOD MORNING CITY COUNCIL AND MR. MAYOR. 
00:37:51 FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU TO SOPHIA KING, ALDERMAN OF 
00:38:00 FOURTH HARD AND SHE MET WITH OUR ORGANIZATION AND WE ASKED HER SOME 
00:38:07 OF THE THINGS SHE HAD DONE TO MAKE OUR WARD BETTER. 
00:38:13 SHE SHARED WITH US SMFT THINGS THAT SHE HAD DONE TO HOLD THE LINE AND 
00:38:19 TO MAKE FOR SURE OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE, SUCH AS TAKEN FOR SURE 
00:38:23 THAT WE DON'T HAVE A PLETHORA OF LIQUOR STORES AND BUSINESS OWNERS 
00:38:29 THAT ARE NOT IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT DON'T HOLD OUR COMMUNITY'S WELFARE 
00:38:36 IN THE BEST INTEREST. 
00:38:38 I WAS DIS EN HEART END WHEN I MET WITH RESIDENTS OF THE 6th WARD, WHO 
00:38:43 TOLD ME THAT THEY DIDN'T SHARE IN THAT SAME CONSIDERATIONS. 
00:38:50 THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE BEEN INUNDATED WITH LIQUOR STORES AND 
00:38:57 THEY HAVE BEEN INUNDATED WITH CRIME. 
00:39:00 THEY HAVE BEEN INUNDATED WITH BUSINESS OWN WHO ARES DON'T SHARE THEIR 
00:39:02 BEST INTEREST. 
00:39:07 I'M ASKING THAT YOU ALDERMAN CONSIDER YOUR RESIDENTS WHEN BUSINESS 
00:39:11 OWNERS COME UP TO YOU AND ASK YOU FOR LICENSES. 
00:39:17 THESE BUSINESS OWNERS ARE THINKING ABOUT THEIR BOTTOM LINE. 
00:39:20 THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THE LIVES OF THE COMMUNITY. 
00:39:22 I'M ASKING YOU TO CONSIDER THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO PUT YOU IN OFFICE. 
00:39:27 ANOTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO BRING TO ATTENTION IS, WHAT I BELIEVE 
00:39:35 TO BE EXTORTION. 
00:39:38 I RECENTLY HAD MY CAR BOOTED AND THE COMPANY WHICH WAS INNOVATIVE 
00:39:43 SOLUTIONS REFUSE TODAY RELEASE MY CAR TO ME. 
00:39:46 NOW THERE IS A CITY MUNICIPAL CODE IS THAT IF THE RESIDENT RETURNS TO 
00:39:58 THE VEHICLE BEFORE THAT TOW COMPANY COMES, THAT VEHICLE IS TO BE 
00:40:04 RELEASED TO THAT MOTORIST. 
00:40:09 I THINK THAT'S 9-84-020. 
00:40:12 THAT ORDINANCE IS NOT BEING FOLLOWED. 
00:40:16 WE ARE BEING FORCE TODAY PAY FEES OF $150 $170 TO GET OUR CARS BACK 
00:40:26 AND THAT IS EXTORTION. 
00:40:29 AND I'M ASK YOU Y'ALL TO HOLD THE LINE ON ALL OF THIS EXTORTION. 
00:40:35 HOW CAN A RESIDENT REMOVE THEIR CAR IF IT HAS A BOOT ON IT. 
00:40:40 AND THE ORDINANCE SAYS IF THE RESIDENT RETURNS TO THE CAR, THEY HAVE 
00:40:43 A RIGHT TO LEAVE. 
00:40:46 YOU CANNOT LEAVE IF THERE IS A BOOT IN YOUR CAR. 
00:40:51 I'M ASK YOU TO FIX THIS. 
00:40:53 >> THANK YOU EVERYONE THE TIME ALLOTTED FOR COMMENT PERIOD HAS ENDED. 
00:40:58 >> RESOLUTIONS?

00:41:48 SUICIDE. 
00:41:49 THE MAN'S EXACT LOCATION WAS NOT KNOWN. 
00:41:52 BUT HIS DESCRIPTION WAS PROSPRIED AND WHERE AS RUSHING TO THE HARBOR 
00:41:57 IN AN EFFORT TO ABORT THIS MAN'S ATTEMPT TO END HIS LIFE, THE POLICE 
00:42:02 OFFICERS SEARCHED THE AREA UNTIL THEY LOCATED THE MAN STANDING ON THE 
00:42:08 EDGE OF THE HARBOR'S ASK TALK TO GO A WOMAN AND THREATENING TO KILL 
00:42:15 HIMSELF. 
00:42:18 COMMANDER BUSLICK AND OFFICER SANCHEZ APPROACHED THE COUPLE AND 
00:42:21 ENGAGED THE MAN IN CONVERSATION ABOUT WHY HE WAS THREAT NOTING 
00:42:25 SUICIDE. 
00:42:27 AND WHERE AS THE CONVERSATION REVEALED THAT THE WOMAN IN DEMAND HAD 
00:42:36 RECENTLY ENDED THE RELATION SHI. SHE FOUND THE NOTE AND CALLED 9-1-1 
00:42:43 INITIATING THE CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT LEAD TO THE CHANTER TO THE SCENE 
00:42:48 THIS POTENTIALLY TRAGIC EVENT. 
00:42:51 ALSO CLAIMING THE VISA BLEED UPSET WOMAN, SAW THAT THE MAN BECAME 
00:42:59 INCREASINGLY AGITATED WHEN OTHER POLICE UNITS BEGAN. 
00:43:03 THEY STARTED TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT HIS WORK AT A SUBURBAN BANK AND 
00:43:14 URGED HIM TO GET HELP. 
00:43:17 SENSING THE MAN WAS AFRAID TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL ALONE, OFFICERS 
00:43:26 ACCOMPANIED HIM AND STAYED WITH HIS DOG AND CALL HIS FATHER. 
00:43:35 HE BROKE DOWN WITH EMOTION AND THANK THE POLICE OFFICERS TO GET HIM 
00:43:43 TO SEEK MEDICAL TREATMENT.

00:44:31 ENCOMPASS THE WORSE MOMENTS OF A PERSON'S LIFE, WHERE DESPAIR AND 
00:44:41 HOPELESSNESS INTERSECT IN A CRITICAL MOMENT. 
00:44:45 IT WAS THE TIME COLLECTED AND REASSURING APPROACH THAT COMMANDER 
00:44:53 BUSLICK AND OFFICER SANCHEZ OF THE 19th DISTRICT THAT THEY EXITED 
00:44:57 WHEN THEY RESPONDED TO THE 9-1-1 CALL AND PURSUEDED TO PURSUE A 
00:45:05 SUICIDAL YOUNG MAN TO PRER*E FRAIN FROM JUMPING INTO LAKE MICHIGAN 
00:45:11 BECAUSE OF A FAILED ROMANCE. 
00:45:16 EXEMPLIFIED BY THE OFFICERS RECOGNIZED HERE IN THIS CHAMBER TODAY, 
00:45:22 IT'S ABOUT, MUCH MORE THAN MAKING AN ARREST. 
00:45:33 A MEMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS WEAR AS MANY HATS. 
00:45:41 AND AT TIMES OF CRISIS OFTEN REQUIRES SERVICE DAYS BY COUNCIL IN 
00:45:52 ORDER TO USE. 
00:45:55 SOMETIMES IT'S JUST AS SIMPLE AS SHARING A FEW WORDS A MOMENT OF 
00:46:02 CHATTING TO THE VULNERABLE AND ISOLATED PERSON FEELS. 
00:46:09 AT OTHER TIMES IT INVOLVES GREAT PERIL. 
00:46:16 COMMANDER BUSLICK AND OFFICER SANCHEZ WERE REQUIRED TO ENGAGE IN 
00:46:25 SUICIDAL, FOLLOWING EMOTIONALLY UPSET. 
00:46:30 COMMANDER UNDERSTOOD THAT BY OPENING A DIALOGUE WITH THE MAN AND 
00:46:35 GETTING HIM TO EXPRESS HIS INNER MOST THOUGHTS THAT THIS COULD BE A 
00:46:44 SYMPATHETIC LISTENER.

01:23:42 >> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:23:44 I TOO I'M PROUD TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RESOLUTION FROM HUMBLE 
01:23:56 GING TO INTERNATIONAL SUCCESS FROM THE ICON I CAN EBONY JET 
01:24:00 BUILDING. 
01:24:04 JOHNSON PU BLIRK HAS ASPIRED COUNTLESS AMERICANS HIGHLIGHTED CHICAGO 
01:24:10 AS A LEADING AMERICAN CITY FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND PROMOTED THE 
01:24:17 ACHIEVEMENT OF BLACK PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. 
01:24:19 JUST A COUPLE OF PERSONAL STORIES. 
01:24:22 MY MOTHER AND FATHER'S 25th WEDDING ANNIVERSARY HAD A PICTURE OF THE 
01:24:28 JET MAGAZINE AND THAT WAS LIKE A BIG DEAL IN MY HOME TOWN OF NEW YORK. 
01:24:37 ALSO EBONY WAS THE ONLY MAGAZINE THAT MY FAMILY DESCRIBED TO AND 
01:24:43 EVERY MONTH, IT WAS JUST SOMETHING TO ENJOY. 
01:24:49 AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I CHOSE CHICAGO AS MY HOME IS 
01:24:55 BECAUSE WHAT I READ IN EBONY JET EVERY MONTH. 
01:25:03 AND I CAN REMEMBER A TEENAGER, GOING INTO MACY'S AND OTHER STORES, 
01:25:09 LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT LIPSTICK IN THE PINK CONTAINERS. 
01:25:13 IT WAS SOMETHING TO BE HOLD. 
01:25:16 AND SO, LINDA, I JUST WANTED TO CONGRATULATE YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP 
01:25:22 OF THE BUSINESS AND YOUR STEWARD SHIP OVER YOUR FAMILY'S LEGACY WHICH 
01:25:27 IS GREAT, NOT ONLY IN CHICAGO BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD. 
01:25:31 AND I WANT TO THANK ALDERMAN KING FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN THE HISTORIC 
01:25:44 AND SUCCESSFUL DESIGNATION OF THE BUILDING. 
01:25:51 IT'S A FEELING OF HOPEFULNESS. 
01:25:52 SO LINDA I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE.

01:26:10 CAUCUS. 
01:26:13 AS PEOPLE KNOW MOTOWN IS KNOWN AS THE SOUND TRACK OF OUR LIFE. 
01:26:19 EBB BEE WAS THE LITERARY OF OUR LIFE. 
01:26:23 EVEN BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO READ AS A CHILD, I WAS ABLE TO GRAB YET AND 
01:26:29 KNEW TO GO TO THE CENTERFOLD. 
01:26:36 SO THAT MAGAZINE, YOU KEPT AND YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO LEARN BY READING 
01:26:42 OR LOOKING AT THE OTHER PICTURES WHETHER IT WAS FROM GREAT FIGURES 
01:26:46 THAT HAD GREAT IMPACT IN OUR LIFE POLITICALLY AND OTHERWISE. 
01:26:52 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M EXCITE BESIDE, WHEN I GOT TO COLLEGE, 
01:27:01 GROWING IN CHICAGO INGLEWOOD, ONLY HAVING A BLACK FRIENDS BUT AFTER 
01:27:11 GOING TO COLLEGE, FINDING MY WHITE FRIENDS. 
01:27:16 IT WAS AN AMERICAN MAGAZINE, AND IT WAS AN AMERICAN STORY. 
01:27:23 SO I ABSOLUTE YOUR DAD, YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY. 
01:27:26 I REALLY ABSOLUTE HIM FOR THE WAY THEY RAISED Y'ALL. 
01:27:31 AS I THINK ABOUT LEGACY AND BUSINESSES IN OUR COMMUNITIES, FAILING 
01:27:35 BECAUSE PEOPLE CANNOT PASS IT DOWN TO THEIR CHILDREN. 
01:27:40 TO WATCH YOU ALL CONTINUE YOUR PARENT'S LEGACY AND NOT LET IT DIE, IT 
01:27:47 A TREMENDOUS ACCOLADE FOR Y'ALL. 
01:27:48 I FRAOESH YOU Y'ALL.

01:28:36 LIPSTICK, EVEN THOUGH MOM WOULD NOT LET ME WEAR IT BUT AT LEAST I HAD 
01:28:41 ONE. 
01:28:45 BUT YOUR MOTHER TAUGHT MANY OF US THE STATUE OF BEING A WELL DRESSED 
01:28:48 INDIVIDUAL. 
01:28:50 AND FOR THAT, I'M FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR. 
01:28:52 BUT FOR ALL THE DOORS THAT MANY OF THEM OPENED FOR MANY OF US, AS

02:58:49 DATED AT CHICAGO ILLINOIS, THIS 22nd DAY OF OCTOBER 19, SIGNED ANA M 
02:58:58 VALENCIA CITY CLERK. 
02:59:04 [TRANSLATING IN SPANISH] 
03:00:36 >> OKAY, ONCE AGAIN ANY PERSON WHO WISHES TO TESTIFY SHOULD SIGN ONE

03:00:52 SERGEANT OF ARMS WILL COLLECT THE SLIPS AND BRING THEM TO THE ROSS 
03:00:56 ROOM. 
03:00:57 I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL ADHERE TO OUR 3-MINUTE REMARKS. 
03:01:02 AND I THINK WE NEED A MOMENT JUST TO GATHER OUR WITNESS SLIPS HERE. 
03:02:00 >> NOW THERE WILL BE AN ANNOUNCEMENT IN SPANISH. 
03:02:06 SPANISH INTERPRETERS ARE AVAILABLE AND WILL THE HEARING IMPAIRED 
03:02:11 INTERPRETER SIGN THAT HE OR SHE IS AVAILABLE. 
03:02:20 >> [TRANSLATING IN SPANISH] 
03:02:59 >> ALL RIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE'RE GOING TO START WITH OUR 
03:03:02 FIRST WITNESS. 
03:03:06 MR. LAWRENCE MASAL OF THE CIVIC FEDERATION. 
03:03:10 HE HASBEEN A WITNESS FOR MANY YEARS. 
03:04:05 >> WE BELIEVE IT'S A REASONABLE PLAN FOR THE COMING YEAR. 
03:04:13 MONTH POSITIVE ASPECTS, THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY NEW TAXES 
03:04:16 AND FEES AND CONTINUES TO INCORPORATE GOOD FINANCIAL PRACTICES. 
03:04:21 HOWEVER, THERE REMAINS SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT FUTURE FINANCIAL 
03:04:25 CHALLENGES THAT THIS SFAOE AND THIS COUNCIL WILL FACE IN THE COMING 
03:04:27 YEARS. 
03:04:31 THESE CHALLENGES INCLUDE, PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO 
03:04:33 INCREASE BY OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. 
03:04:40 PROJECTED INCREASES AND CORPORATE FUND SHORTFALL OF AT LEAST 250 
03:04:44 MILLION NEXT YEAR AND MORE IN 2021, A DEBT BURDEN THAT CONTINUES TO 
03:04:51 GROW AND PENDER LABOR NEGOTIATIONS WHICH MAY AD SIGNIFICANT STRESS. 
03:04:55 THE FEDERATION IS INCLUDED MANY ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE 
03:05:00 FULL 98-REPORT WHICH TIME WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO GO INTO. 
03:05:03 INSTEAD I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS MY REMAINING TIME FOR SDSC, AS YOU 
03:05:13 KNOW, THE SDSC IS A LOCK BOX DESIGNED TO INTERCEPT STATE REVENUE TAX 
03:05:19 BEFORE THEY LAND IN THE TREASURY IN ORDER TO GARDNER LESS COST OF 
03:05:25 BORROWING. 
03:05:27 DUE TO ITS STRUCTURE, THEY HAVE ISSUED DEBT AT A MUCH LOWER DEBT, 
03:05:33 THERE BY SAVING THE CITY AND TAXPAYERS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN 
03:05:36 INTEREST COSTS. 
03:05:38 WHILE WE'RE ENCOURAGED THAT THE CITY FOUND THIS HIGH DPET BURDENS, 
03:05:44 WE'RE AT MUCH GREATER FRANCE PARENT SEE AND MUCH MORE DISCUSSION WITH 
03:05:48 THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSACTIONS WILL BE MANAGED. 
03:05:53 IN PARTICULAR THE FEDERATION HAS CONCERNS ABOUT POSSIBLE USE OF 1.3 
03:06:00 BILLION DOLLARS IN REFINANCING OF OUR EXISTING DEBT. 
03:06:04 IT'S EXPECT TODAY INCLUDE OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS TO REFUND 
03:06:09 THE EXISTING DAET THAT MAY NOT MATURE UNTIL 2024, AS LONG AS NINE 
03:06:16 YEARS. 
03:06:19 WHILE THE OFFICIALS HAVE EXPLICITLY SAID THEY WILL NOT USE SCOOP AND 
03:06:25 TOSS, AND THIS WILL NOT RELATE TO SCOOP AND TOSS, WE'RE CONCERNED 
03:06:31 THAT THE CITY IS CONSIDERING EXTENDING THE DEBT IN ORDER TO RELIEF. 
03:06:36 >> DO YOU THINK YOU CAN GIVE US A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ABOUT THAT? 
03:06:40 >> YES. 
03:06:45 SO BY EXTENDING THE BEYOND THE EXISTING TERM OF THE DEBT, WE HAVE FOR 
03:06:50 GOING SAVINGS AT A GREATER COST. 
03:06:53 AND WE'RE PUTTING INTO QUESTION HOW FUTURE BORROWING WILL TAKE PLACE 
03:07:02 IN 20-50s, WE BELIEVE THAT WHILE THE STRUCTURE IS APPROPRIATE AND 
03:07:05 USEFUL, IT NEEDS TO BE MONITORED AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A PUBLIC 
03:07:09 VETTING OF HOW THE RISK ASSOCIATED WILL BE MANAGED. 
03:07:14 THANK YOU I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. 
03:07:18 >> DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS? 
03:07:21 >> ALDERMAN MOORE. 
03:07:25 >> GOOD AFTERNOON, SO IN ESSENCE, THE YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE MAY BE A 
03:07:35 WORTH AN IDEA WORTH LOOKING AT BUT IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL WITHOUT 
03:07:39 FURTHER DETAIL WHETHER THIS IS A GOOD IDEA? 
03:07:42 >> WELL I THINK, THE CITY IS ALREADY, USED THIS SECURITY AND 
03:07:49 EFFECTIVELY TO REDUCE IT'S BORROWING COST AND AT A MUCH LOWER RATE, 
03:07:53 THAN IT IF IT WENT UNDER ITS GENERAL OBLIGATION BORROWING. 
03:07:58 HOWEVER THE PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT THAT IS BEING DISCUSSED 
03:08:03 FOR ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS TRENCH HAS US NOT ONLY TAKING ADVANTAGE 
03:08:07 OF THE STRUCTURE TO REDUCE THE COST OF BORROWING BUT WE'RE PUSHING 
03:08:12 OUT THAT BORROWING ANOTHER 9 YEARS BEYOND WHICH IS THE EXISTING DEBT 
03:08:16 IS. 
03:08:18 AND THAT IS GOING TO LIMIT FUTURE MAYORS AND FUTURE CITY COUNSEL ORS 
03:08:25 TO USE DEBT FOR CAPITOL PURPOSES DURING THE 2030. 
03:08:30 >> SO WE'LL BE TYING THE HANDS OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN'S? 
03:08:37 >> YES, WHAT WE'RE URGING AND WHAT WE ENCOURAGE THIS BODY TO ASK AND 
03:08:41 HAVE A PUBLIC VETTING WHY IT'S NECESSARY TO PUSH THOSE OUT. 
03:08:47 IS IT JUST TO PROVIDE BIMGT AIRY RELIEF RIGHT NOW, OR IS THERE 
03:08:51 SOMETHING THAT WE'RE NOT AWARE OF THAT HAS TO BE MADE PUBLIC? 
03:08:55 >> AND, DOES THE CIVIC FEDERATION HAVE ANY OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS ON 
03:09:01 WHAT WE IN THE CITY COUNCIL CAN DO TO ADDRESS THIS ONE BILLION 
03:09:07 DOLLARS CLIP THAT WE'LL BE FACING IN THE NEXT TERM? 
03:09:09 >> WE DO. 
03:09:11 AND INCLUDING, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY HOW YOU'RE HANDLING THE CLAWS FALL 
03:09:16 IN THE REPORT ON THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING DPRAOEMENT MAKING SURE 
03:09:21 THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE FISCAL IMPLICATION FOR THEM. 
03:09:24 BUT IN TERMS OF MEETING THAT PENSION CLAUSE, THERE NEEDS TO BE, NOT 
03:09:29 FROM THE FEDERATION STAND POINT A LATE LEGISLATE I'VE SOLUTION TO 
03:09:35 BRING DOWN SOME OF THE COSTS UNFOUNDED BY AUTHORITY. 
03:09:38 THE CITY IS NOT ALONE IN TERMS OF FACING A SA REER PENSION RELATED 
03:09:42 CRISIS. 
03:09:44 ALL OF WHICH AS YOU KNOW, WAS AUTHORIZED BY STATE STA FEW. 
03:09:51 SXL MAYOR EMANUEL AND OF THE MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL DESERVE 
03:09:57 CREDIT FOR TAKING THE STANCE OF RAISING TAXES AND TRYING TO STAEBL 
03:10:02 EYES. 
03:10:03 >> MOST OF US. 
03:10:04 >> YES. 
03:10:05 BUT SERIOUSLY, THE CHALLENGE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FACE IN LESS THAN 
03:10:10 TWO YEARS IS REALLY AS SOON AS NEXT YEAR WITH THE BUDGET DEFICIT IS 
03:10:15 THE PRESSURE OF THE PENSION ARE GOING TO PUSH OUT OTHER RESOURCES FOR 
03:10:21 A CHANCE OF PROVIDING OTHER CRITICAL SERVICES. 
03:10:23 THERE NEEDS TO BE A STRAIGHTFORWARD SOLUTION. 
03:10:25 THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE TO COME UP WITH A 
03:10:31 COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION. 
03:10:32 WHETHER IT IS THAT THE STATE IS GOING TO ALLOW FOR MORE CONSOLATION 
03:10:37 OF THE PENSION FUND. 
03:10:38 WHETHER THE STATE IS GOING TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS FOR 
03:10:42 CONSIDERATION OF MOLD. 
03:10:46 UNFORTUNATELY, ILLINOIS, GENERAL A SEM BLEED AND THE GOVERNOR HAVE 
03:10:49 NOT COME TOGETHER IN A MEANINGFUL WAY TO REDUCE THEIR OWN STATE 
03:10:55 LIABILITIES, WE FEEL STRONGLY WE'LL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR THIS 
03:10:59 GOVERNOR AND NEW MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL A SEM BLEED AND TO ANY FUTURE 
03:11:04 GOVERNOR. 
03:11:06 IT IS GOING TO REQUIRE MORE, REVENUE BUT IT IS ALSO SHOULD REQUIRE 
03:11:14 SACRIFICE AND REDUCTION IN THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY. 
03:11:19 >> WE HAVE THE CHALLENGE OF COURSE THE STATE CONSTITUTIONAL 
03:11:27 PROHIBITION AGAINST ALTERING PENSION PLANS THAT ALREADY IN PLACE. 
03:11:33 SHORT OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT CAN CHANGE THAT. 
03:11:36 DO YOU SEE ANY OTHER AVENUES THAT THE STATE MAY EXPLORE THAT WOULD 
03:11:42 NOT AFFECT THE PENSIONS AS THEY ARE CURRENTLY CONSTITUTED? 
03:11:47 >> AS PART OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET, THEY INCLUDED AN EXPERIMENT IN 
03:11:55 BUYING OUT THEIR RETIRING EMPLOYEE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO GIVE 
03:11:59 THEM 70% OF THE NET OF VALUE OF THEIR 3% IN EXCHANGE FOR TAKING A 
03:12:04 LOWER COLO. 
03:12:06 THE STATE ESTIMATED, THEY DIDN'T USE AN ACTUAL ANALYSIS BUT THEY 
03:12:15 ESTIMATED THAT IT COULD SAVE THEM TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND THEY'RE 
03:12:19 SLOW IN GETTING THAT IMPLEMENTED. 
03:12:22 THAT IS GIVING THEM SOMETHING THAT MOST PENSION EXPERT AND SCHOLARS 
03:12:26 BELIEVE THAT THERE IS THE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE AND OFFER THINGS TO 
03:12:32 THE EMPLOYEES AND RETIRING EMPLOYEES TO EXCHANGE FOR SOME OF THE 
03:12:36 OTHER POLICIES. 
03:12:41 >> AND FINALLY, THERE WERE SOME OF THE CANDIDATES FOR MAYOR HAVE 
03:12:48 SUGGESTED RELYING ON GAMBLING CASINO AND REVENUE DRIVE FROM THE 
03:12:56 LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA AS SOLUTIONS TO OR AT LEAST PARTIALLY 
03:13:02 SOLUTION TO SEE OUR CITY PENSION, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOSE? 
03:13:08 >> I THINK ALL OF US HAVE WATCHED SPRINGFIELD AND STATE LEGISLATION 
03:13:17 GAM NL. 
03:13:19 SO ANY CONFIDENCE AS TO WHAT THE CITY WILL DERIVE OR WHAT IT WILL 
03:13:25 HAVE TO GET BH THEY GET AN EXPANSION OF GAMBLING. 
03:13:30 ALSO CONSIDER THE OTHER ISSUE THAT IS MARIJUANA THAT HAS BEEN TALKED 
03:13:36 ABOUT FOR FULL LEGALIZATION AND SPORTS GAMBLING AS BEING THE SOLUTION 
03:13:41 TO ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. 
03:13:44 WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER STATES, IN COLORADO IS THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE 
03:13:49 FROM LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA IS RELATIVELY SMALL IN THE HUNDREDS OF 
03:13:53 MILLIONS FOR THE STATE OF COLORADO. 
03:13:57 AND THE COST OF MANAGING, LICENSING IT AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE 
03:14:02 THE STRUCTURE IN PLACE, TO CONTROL IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. 
03:14:06 THE CIVIC FEDERATION DOES NOT A POSITION ON THE FULL LEGALIZATION OF 
03:14:11 MARIJUANA. 
03:14:13 WE HAVE A LOT MORE QUESTIONS THAN WE HAVE SEEN REAL DETAILED 
03:14:17 PROPOSALS ON HOW IT WILL WORK. 
03:14:23 WE NOW HAVE LICENSED MEDICAL NEEDS, I THINK THAT WILL BE HOW IT ROLLS 
03:14:27 OUT. 
03:14:29 OUR BIGGEST CONCERN IS WHEN THE SOLUTION TO YOUR PENSION PROBLEM IS 
03:14:36 THAT BEING DRIVEN BY ADVOCATES THAT WANT TO EXPAND FROM OUTSIDE OF 
03:14:40 THE REGULATION OR BRING IT IN AS A LEGALIZED ACTIVITY. 
03:14:45 WE TEND TO NOT FULLY ANALYZE WHAT THE REVENUE IS FEELING. 
03:14:48 I DON'T THINK THAT THERE ARE ANY AMNESTY VIA MARIJUANA, GAMBLING OR 
03:14:58 BE IT ANOTHER CASINO. 
03:15:00 YOU HAVE TO BE MORE REALISTIC AND LOOK AT WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET 
03:15:04 THE MONEY TO PAY FOR IT. 
03:15:05 >> THANK YOU. 
03:15:09 APPRECIATE YOUR ALL THE WORK YOUR ORGANIZATION DOES. 
03:15:10 >> THANK YOU. 
03:15:14 >> ALDERMAN THOMPSON. 
03:15:18 >> HI LAWRENCE. 
03:15:26 >> I JUST CAN'T RESIST. 
03:15:30 SO I HAVE A QUESTION, ON THIS SALES TAX, I'LL JUST SAY, THAT I WAS 
03:15:38 JUST HANDED THE REPORT SO I HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO READ THROUGH THE 
03:15:41 FULL REPORT. 
03:15:44 BUT BY LOCK BOXING AND SECURE THE BONDHOLDER OR ASSURANCE THE BOND 
03:15:50 HOLDERS THAT THEY WOULD BE PAID FIRST, THAT ALLOWED US TO ACHIEVE AAA 
03:15:56 CREDIT ON THE FIRST BONDAGE. 
03:15:59 SO LOOKING AT YOUR REPORT REAL QUICK, 500 MILLION DOLLARS. 
03:16:09 I'M SORRY WE ACHIEVED 88 MILLION. 
03:16:14 I'M LOST, BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO DO ANOTHER ONE OF THESE DEALS. 
03:16:19 WHY IS IT MORE MORE RISKY THAN WE DID IT A DEAL THAT REFUNDED 563 
03:16:28 MILLION DOLLARS OF TAX BONDS. 
03:16:34 SO WE DID A DEAL FOR A BILLION 5, AND IT WORKED AND HAD 800 MILLION 
03:16:45 OF SAVINGS 6789 
03:16:52 >> SO OUR CONCERN IS THIS. 
03:16:53 NOT ON THE STRUCTURE. 
03:16:55 THAT YOU CLEARLY GET A REDUCED INTEREST RATE OR SAVINGS TO THE CITY 
03:17:00 TO THE TAXPAYER AS A RESULT OF THAT. 
03:17:02 IT'S PUSHING OUT THE LEVEL OF REPAYMENT ON THAT DEBT. 
03:17:06 AT ANY TIMES A STRAIGHT REFINANCING WHERE THE EXISTING DEBT WHICH 
03:17:13 WOULD EXPIRE BY 2044, UNDER WHAT WE'RE HEARING AND WE'RE NOT SEEING 
03:17:18 THE FULL DETAIL WOULD BE THAT IT THE BILLION DOLLARS FINAL PAYMENT 
03:17:26 WOULD BE IN 2053, NINE YEARS BEYOND OF WHICH THE DEBT. 
03:17:33 AND THERE MIGHT BE A REASON. 
03:17:35 WE JUST HAVE NOT SEEN WHY THAT'S NECESSARY IS NOT JUST TO PROVIDE 
03:17:40 BUDGETARY RELIEF? 
03:17:41 OR IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE WE'RE FOR GOING THE SAVING, WE'RE 
03:17:48 GOING TO PAY MORE. 
03:17:50 >> I GET IT. 
03:17:51 SO I HEAR YOU. 
03:17:52 THE CONCERN IS THAT THE TIME AND MONEY, WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE DETAILS 
03:17:57 OF THIS DPAEL EITHER? 
03:18:01 BUT IF, IF IT'S A STRAIGHT G.O. AND WE FINANCE AND SPREAD IT OVER A 
03:18:07 LONGER PERIOD OF TIME AND THERE IS A NET SAVING, THAT MAY MAKE SENSE 
03:18:13 IF THERE IS A SAVING. 
03:18:15 SO I UNDERSTAND NOW. 
03:18:17 IT'S JUST BECAUSE OF THE DETAILS OF IT. 
03:18:19 >> YES, IT A PAE,Z OR AT LEAST WHAT WE'RE BEING TOLD, THERE WILL BE 
03:18:24 IN THAT SAVINGS, IN THAT PRESENT SAVINGS, IT WILL BE LESS THAN IT 
03:18:30 WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS WITH WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING. 
03:18:36 BY GOING OUT ANOTHER NINE YEARS BEYOND WHICH, WE'RE NOT BUYING 
03:18:39 ANYTHING NEW. 
03:18:41 THIS IS A TOTAL REFINANCE AND WE'RE JUST PAYING AT A LOWER, BUT WE'RE 
03:18:49 GOING TO TAKE NINE MORE YEARS. 
03:18:51 WE DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFICITY ON IT. 
03:18:54 THAT'S OUR CONCERN. 
03:18:55 IF I CAN SUM TUP. 
03:18:57 IF YOU'RE GOING TO REFINANCE THAT AND MATCHING IT TO THE TERM OF 
03:19:03 EXISTING DEBT, SAVES YOU MORE MONEY THAN PUSHING IT OUT FURTHER. 
03:19:07 >> I THINK THAT'S THAT WAS IN THE DETAIL ON THE DEAL STRUCTURE, WE 
03:19:11 CANNOT JUST COME IN AND REFINANCE FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME AND 
03:19:17 JUST REDUCE IT AT A LOWER INTEREST RATE. 
03:19:20 THAT'S NOT, DOES NOT SOUND LIKE THE DEAL. 
03:19:26 THAT WE'RE BEING OFFERED JUST BECAUSE WE WANT TO, WE NEED TO HAVE A 
03:19:30 BANK THAT WILL BOND IT. 
03:19:31 >> RIGHT. 
03:19:32 >> SO I THINK THAT'S THE OTHER PART. 
03:19:37 OKAY AND THEN JUST ON THE AS WE'RE IN BUDGET SEASON NOW. 
03:19:42 WE LOOKED AT THE START OF THIS SEASON, IN 2008, THE BUDGET DEFICIT 
03:19:49 WAS ABOUT 65 MILLION DOLLARS. 
03:19:55 IN 2009 2009, IT WAS 629 MILLION DOLLARS. 
03:20:02 I KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE PENSION, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE RECOGNIZE OR 
03:20:06 TALK ABOUT THE HE SESSION THAT WE WERE IN AND OBVIOUSLY, THE CITY MY 
03:20:14 COLLEAGUES REALIZE THAT WAS THE WORSE TIME TO RAISE PROPERTY TAXES 
03:20:18 WHEN YOU HAVE A 625 MILLION DOLLARS DEFICIT WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO 
03:20:23 ARE NOT PAYING THEIR PROPERTY TAX OR SALES TAX WHICH WASED THE $625 
03:20:28 MILLION DEFICIT. 
03:20:31 SO IT WAS CREATIVE SOLUTION WAS THE PARKING METRE DEAL, 
03:20:36 SECURITYIZATION. 
03:20:38 SO YOU KNOW, HOW THAT IMPACTS ON THE PENSION, AND HOW DO WE COME BACK 
03:20:44 TO YOUR SAYING, WE SHOULD NOT LOOK AT MARIJUANA, SALES, YOU DON'T 
03:20:52 WANT TO LOOK AT GAMBLING AND OTHER THINGS ALTERNATIVE CREATIVE. 
03:20:59 MY QUESTION IS, WHAT ELSE, WE CANNOT AS BASICALLY AS SAY WE'RE GOING 
03:21:04 TO RAISE TAXES. 
03:21:05 >> THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY. 
03:21:08 WE'RE NOT SAYING YOU SHOULD NOT LOOK AT WHATEVER REVENUE SOURCE YOU 
03:21:13 WANT TO IDENTIFY BUT WHAT DRIVES THE DISCUSSION NOT ONLY IN THIS 
03:21:17 COUNCIL BUT IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE IS IT'S LEGAL TO EXPAND 
03:21:22 MARIJUANA. 
03:21:25 THERE IS NOT A FULL CONSTITUENT' THAT I'M AWARE OF. 
03:21:31 THERE IS A FULL CON STEW ANT SEE THAT WANT TO PROMOTE GAMBLING AND 
03:21:38 LOOK AT THAT. 
03:21:40 YOU SHOULD LOOK AT ALL THAT, AND LOOK AT WHAT MONEY WILL GENERATE. 
03:21:45 AND YOU CANNOT STOP THERE WHEN THAT MONEY OF MONEY DOES NOT ADDRESS 
03:21:49 THE PROBLEM. 
03:21:51 WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO STAEBL EYES SO THAT WE CAN MOVE THE 
03:21:56 CREDIT RATING UP SO THAT WE CAN SECURITY THE CITY'S ABILITY TO 
03:22:01 INCREST IN ALL THE OTHER AREAS. 
03:22:04 >> OKAY, AND DOES THE CIVIC FEDERATION HAVE A PLAN THAT THEY PROPOSED? 
03:22:12 >> WE PROPOSED SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADDRESSING A LOT OF AREAS 
03:22:15 IN THE CITY GOVERNMENT. 
03:22:18 THE ISSUE OF PENSIONER WE LOOK AT A STATE WIDE ISSUE. 
03:22:22 WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. 
03:22:25 WINDOW ADVOCATE FOR THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, NOT TO PUSH THE PROBLEMS 
03:22:29 DOWN ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT LIKE THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 
03:22:32 WE ADVOCATE FOR A PENSION SOLUTION THAT IS COMPREHENSIVE IN NATURE 
03:22:37 THAT WOULD ASSIST NOT JUST THE CITY AND NOT JUST THE CHICAGO PUBLIC 
03:22:44 SCHOOLS BUT THE KNEW NIS PALTS THAT HAVE THEIR OWN LOCAL PLACE. 
03:22:50 IT'S EXPENSIVE. 
03:22:53 WE DUG A WHOLE AND ALLOWED OUR SEND UNDER PENSION. 
03:22:58 BECAUSE IT REQUIRED CERTAIN THINGS. 
03:23:00 BUT NOW, IT'S PRESSING DOWN ON THE CITY OF CHICAGO'S ABILITY TO FUND 
03:23:05 THE OTHER AREAS OF GOVERNMENT. 
03:23:07 >> WELL, AGAIN, I JUST I'M NOT DISPUTING, I THINK THERE IS A 
03:23:13 DISMISSAL OF THE RECESSION THAT HAPPENED IN 2008. 
03:23:17 PENSION FUNDS ALSO LOST. 
03:23:19 IT'S OFTEN REFERRED AND AGAIN IT WAS PRIOR BUT JUST IN DEFENSE OF ALL 
03:23:26 LEGISLATIVE BODIES, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
03:23:31 IT WAS NOT MISMANAGEMENT, WE HAD A TAKE A CRIES. 
03:23:34 AND IF WE TAKE A CRISIS AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAVED THE BANK 
03:23:41 INDUSTRY AND AUTO. 
03:23:43 WHY DON'T THEY COME TO LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES AND ISSUE US THE MONEY SO 
03:23:50 WE CAN SAVE OUR PENSION AND WE'LL PAY BAKT GOVERNMENT JUST LIKE THE 
03:23:55 BANK AND AUTO INDUSTRY DID. 
03:23:57 HAVE WE LOOKED AT THAT. 
03:23:58 >> WE HAVE. 
03:24:02 WE FIND LITTLE TRACTION AMONG THE CONGRESS ESPECIALLY FOR A BAILOUT 
03:24:06 FOR THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT SFR UNDER WATER PENSION. 
03:24:12 THERE ARE MANY OF STATES AND GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE NT. 
03:24:18 BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE A NATIONAL SECURITY. 
03:24:25 CORPORATION WHICH BASICALLY PROVIDES A MUCH DISCOUNTED BENEFIT OF 
03:24:33 COMPANIES GOING INTO THEIR FEDERAL SUPPORT WHEN THEY TURN THEIR 
03:24:37 PENSION OVER. 
03:24:38 >> SURE. 
03:24:44 SEARS HAS 90,000 RETIREES, 90,000 PENSIONERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE 
03:24:46 IMPACTED. 
03:24:47 WE DON'T HAVE THAT AND NOR DO WE LOOK TO FILE BANKRUPTCY OR PROVIDE A 
03:24:54 DISCOUNTED BENEFIT TO OUR RETIREE. 
03:24:55 THEY EARNED IT AND WORKED HARD. 
03:24:57 THEY RUN IT. 
03:24:59 I'M JUST LOOKING FOR, I MEAN IT'S EASY, AND I HAVE RESPECT FOR CIVIC 
03:25:08 FEDERATION, WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS. 
03:25:09 WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE. 
03:25:12 AND FOR PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO FLOW DARTS, THAT'S ONE THING. 
03:25:16 LET'S COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS, WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS AND WHETHER 
03:25:21 THAT IS A STATE PLAN OR COME PREHEN SIF REPORT. 
03:25:29 AND WE SHOULD SEE THAT. 
03:25:31 I WOULD APPRECIATE YOU SHARING THAT WITH ME AS WELL. 
03:25:35 SO WE CAN ADVOCATE EVEN IF IT'S IN THIS BODY OR WASHINGTON. 
03:25:42 >> RIGHT, I'LL BE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU AND MAKE 
03:25:49 RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE GOVERNOR ON WHAT THEY CAN DO TO ADDRESS IT. 
03:25:53 RECENTLY PRIOR TO THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED EKT, THEY TAUFPD HOW YOU CAN 
03:26:01 ADDRESS THE DEFICIT THERE. 
03:26:02 >> FANTASTIC. 
03:26:03 >> THANK YOU. 
03:26:04 >> THANK YOU. 
03:26:10 >> CHAIRMAN BURKE. 
03:26:15 >> GOOD AFTERNOON, WELCOME TO THIS ANNUAL THAT YOU'VE DONE FOR HOW 
03:26:21 MANY YEARS? 
03:26:23 >> I BELIEVE IT'S 7. 
03:26:25 >> AND YOU'RE GETTING BETTER AT IT. 
03:26:30 PROBABLY WERE HERE EARLY TORE HEAR THE INTRODUCTION OF STREET MATTERS 
03:26:37 JOIN THE INCREASE OF FAX ON REAL ESTATE BY 3% AS A CIVIC FEDERATION 
03:26:50 DONE ANY EFFECTS ON WHAT EFFECT THAT WILL DO? 
03:26:53 >> WE HAVE NOT HAD A OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK SPECIFICALLY. 
03:26:56 WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE AN EXISTING TRANSACTION, TRANSFER. 
03:27:02 AND WE ALSO RELY ON IT FOR THE TRANSIT AUTHORITY. 
03:27:06 SO THE PROPOSAL WHICH WE READ ABOUT IN NEWS ACCOUNTS IS ONE THAT WE 
03:27:10 HAVE NOT FULLY ANALYZED. 
03:27:13 WE DO HAVE CONCERNS AS, THE ALDERMAN POINTED OUT THE CITY HAS ITS OWN 
03:27:22 EXISTING FINANCIAL CALENDAR GOING FORTH AND HOW THEY WOULD FAN 
03:27:25 PROGRAMMING ON SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE A AN ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY IF 
03:27:31 WE HAD AN CON TICK DOWN TURN THAT WE SAW AS RECENTLY AS THE LAST 7 OR 
03:27:37 8 YEARS AGO. 
03:27:43 >> YOU THINK THAT THE CIVIC FEDERATION WILL TAKE THIS SUBJECT UP? 
03:27:49 >> I THINK IF IT ENDS UP BEING AN ISSUE ON THE BA LORKTS IF THERE WAS 
03:27:56 ACTUALLY, TALKERING ABOUT DOING THEN WE, WE WOULD TAKE A HARD LOOK AT 
03:28:01 IT AND TRY TO PROVIDE SOME OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF HOW GOOD IT MAY BE 
03:28:07 OR MIGHT NOT. 
03:28:08 >> THANK YOU. 
03:28:11 >> ALDERMAN ARENA. 
03:28:14 >> THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. 
03:28:18 ARE YOU DOING TODAY, SIR. 
03:28:20 >> GOOD THANK YOU. 
03:28:22 >> I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING UP THE SALES TAX. 
03:28:30 SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAD CONCERNS ABOUT WHEN WE WERE 
03:28:36 EVALUATING THAT PROPOSAL WAS THAT THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE 
03:28:40 A NEW VERSION OF SCOOP AND TOSS. 
03:28:43 NOW, I'M TOLD FROM SOME BACK AND FORTH THAT, WE'RE NOT CALLING IT 
03:28:46 THAT. 
03:28:48 COULD YOU GIVE ME YOUR OPINION ON HOW DOES THIS MOVE OR THIS 
03:28:54 STRUCTURE RELATE TO WHAT WAS GOING ON WHEN WE WERE USING THE FORMALLY 
03:29:00 NAME, SCOOP AND TOSS. 
03:29:02 IS IT A CORRELATION? 
03:29:03 IF A DIFFERENT PRACTICE? 
03:29:04 DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION? 
03:29:08 >> SO A TRADITIONAL DEFINITION OF SCOOP AND TOSS IS THAT YOU EXTEND 
03:29:12 THE MATURITY ON YOUR DEBT AND THUS INCREASE YOUR BORROWING. 
03:29:18 THE STRUCTURE THAT IS BEING PROPOSED WOULD EXTEND YOUR MATURE ITS BUT 
03:29:28 DECREASE YOUR BORROWING PROCESS BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE SOME PRESENT. 
03:29:33 AND SO. 
03:29:34 >> SO YOU'RE SAYING SCOOP AND TOSS YOU WERE NOT NECESSARILY GETTING A 
03:29:40 BETTER RATE ON THE RETURN, ON THE DEBT. 
03:29:42 YOU WERE JUST REFINANCING AND IT DIDN'T MATTER IF THE RATE WAS HIGHER 
03:29:47 OR LOCATIONER YOU WERE JUST EXTENDING. 
03:29:50 >> YOU WERE PROVIDING IMMEDIATE BUDGETARY RELIEF RATHER THAN MAKE THE 
03:29:55 PAYMENT ON THE PRINCIPAL. 
03:30:00 SO YOU BASICALLY, JUST REFINANCE WHAT COST MORE AS THE FURTHER YOU GO 
03:30:03 OUT. 
03:30:06 AND USED THE MONEY FROM THE REFINANCE. 
03:30:11 >> YES, SO I GUESS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE I'M HERE IS THERE WAS NO 
03:30:16 ENTITY THAT PROVIDE YOU THE RELIEF OF A LOW INTEREST RATE OF SOME 
03:30:23 AMOUNT. 
03:30:26 IT WAS WHATEVER IT WAS VERSUS WHEN IT WAS ISSUED YEARS BACK. 
03:30:37 >> YEAH, YOU'RE SUMMARIZING, BASICALLY. 
03:30:38 >> OKAY. 
03:30:41 AT THIS POINT, YOU DON'T HAVE THE SENSE OF WHAT THE SAVINGS IS ON THE 
03:30:46 DEBT THAT IS BEING CONSIDERED RIGHT NOW AT ITS OLD RATE VERSUS NEW 
03:30:50 RATE? 
03:30:51 IS THAT TRUE? 
03:31:02 I THINK THE HEARING IN TERMS OF SAVINGS IS THAT IT WOULD BE MORE 
03:31:08 SIGNIFICANT THAN THE PREVIOUS 88 MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVING FROM THE 
03:31:11 LAST PREPLAN. 
03:31:14 BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT. 
03:31:15 >> WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET. 
03:31:17 >> THE OTHER ASPECT OF THIS, THERE IS OPINION SOME REPORT THATING THE 
03:31:25 STRUCTURE IS MILLION DOLLARS TO BE PAID AT THE END OF THE TERMS. 
03:31:29 >> TOTAL OF BORROWING OF 1.3 BILLION, THERE IS ONE BILLION DOLLARS 
03:31:35 THAT IS GOING TO BE LEFT AT THE END OF THE TERMS THAT EXTEND TO 2045 
03:31:42 AND 2053. 
03:31:43 >> RIGHT. 
03:31:44 MY UNDERSTANDING, YES. 
03:31:49 >> WAS THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS DPUN WHEN THE DEBT WAS BACK LOADED? 
03:31:53 >> YEAH. 
03:31:54 AT ANY TIMES THE RECOMMENDED STRUCTURE BUT IT'S NOT A AN EXOTIC 
03:32:02 STRUCTURE FOR OTHERS TO REDUCE THE INITIAL. 
03:32:10 >> WOULD YOU CONSIDER A BILLION DOLLARS BEING BACK LOADED ON A TOTAL 
03:32:17 FRONT OF 1.3 BILLION DOLLARS TO BE ACCESSIVE. 
03:32:21 I CAN UNDERSTAND SOME BACK LOADING BUT THAT SEEMS. 
03:32:25 >> WITHOUT THE DETAIL, WITHOUT THE PUBLIC VETING OF WHY THE STRUCTURE 
03:32:32 IS BEING ESTABLISHED THIS WAY, WHY ISN'T IT MATCHING UP THE EXISTING 
03:32:36 RATE REPAYMENT APPROXIMATELY SCHEDULE TO A NEW SIMILAR TERM FOR 
03:32:41 REPAYMENT, I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEASURE. 
03:32:48 THERE MIGHT BE AN EXPLANATION. 
03:32:50 LET ME CORRECT MYSELF. 
03:32:51 THERE IS AN EXPLANATION THERE IS SOMETHING BEHIND THE FINANCIAL 
03:32:56 STRUCTURE, WHY THE CITY IS CHOOSING THAT OR WHY IT'S THINKING OF 
03:33:01 CHOOSING THAT IS THE ANSWER, I DON'T KNOW. 
03:33:04 >> I HOPE THAT THE CIVIC FEDERATION CONTINUES TO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS 
03:33:09 AND COME BACK WITH SMFT THINGS ON THIS WHEN IT HAS MORE INFORMATION. 
03:33:13 BECAUSE THIS SEEMS TO RAISE THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY MYSELF 
03:33:18 AND OTHERS WHEN WE WERE ENTERING INTO THIS, THAT WE'RE REPEATING THE 
03:33:23 HISTORY. 
03:33:24 IT WAS A REASON WHY WE DID SCOOP AND TOSS. 
03:33:28 THE PROBLEM IS IT LOADED US WITH SO MUCH ADDITIONAL DEBT THAT IT PUT 
03:33:35 US INTO REALLY TROUBLING FINANCIAL WATERS THAT THE MAYOR SAID HE WAS 
03:33:39 NOT PULLING US OUT OF. 
03:33:40 BUT IF WE'RE REPEATING THE SAME PRACTICE UNDER A DIFFERENT COVER, 
03:33:45 THAT RAISES CONCERNS IN MY MIND. 
03:33:48 SOY HOPE THAT THE CIVIC FEDERATION WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THIS. 
03:33:53 IT'S ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT THIS DEAL THAT WAS ROTEDER YESTERDAY, 
03:33:58 HAS BEEN PUT ON DAY-TO-DAY STATUS. 
03:34:01 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF WHETHER THE DEAL IS GOING FORWARD IN 
03:34:04 YOUR MIND? 
03:34:05 >> I THINK IT CAN GO, AT ANY TIME BASED ON THAT. 
03:34:20 WE HAVE BEEN ASKING SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS. 
03:34:30 WE'LL BE DOING THE SAME, THANK YOU MA DPAM CHAIR. 
03:34:38 >> ALDERMAN SMITH. 
03:34:40 >> YES, I HAVE JUST LOOKING AT THIS. 
03:34:48 AS WELL AS YOUR ALWAYS CAREFUL ANALYSIS. 
03:35:03 THIS IS THE LAUNCH OF 3 BILLION DOLLARS THAT THE COUNCIL APPROVED 
03:35:06 JUST OVER A YEAR AGO. 
03:35:08 >> THIS WAS PART OF THE, IT WAS AUTHORIZED BY THE ILLINOIS GENERAL 
03:35:13 JUST OVER A YEAR AGO. 
03:35:44 WHETHER IT'S GOING TO OUR FINANCE COMMITTEE. 
03:35:47 >> I WOULD SAY THAT THIS COUNCIL DID AUTHORITY THE USE OF UP. 
03:35:54 >> UP TO 3 BILLION DOLLARS JUST WITHIN THAT BUDGET. 
03:35:59 >> I HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK OF MR. CHAIRMAN, TO KNOW WHETHER THIS 
03:36:08 PUBLIC BOND SERIES IS SUBJECT TO COMMITTEE OR CITY APPROVAL OR 
03:36:17 WHETHER THE ENTER CITY HAS THE POWER TO ISSUE THAT BOND AS PART OF 
03:36:24 THE OVERALL APPROVAL THAT WAS GIVEN A YEAR OR SO AGO. 
03:36:46 >> CHAIRMAN BURKE, ALDERMAN SMITH CAN YOU RPT QUESTION. 
03:36:50 >> THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN BURKE, PRESIDENT HAS RAISED THE QUESTION OF 
03:36:58 ADDITIONAL, ABOUT A TRENCH 1.3 BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT OUT OF THE 
03:37:02 SALES TAX SECURIZATION CORPORATION. 
03:37:04 AND THIS COUNCIL AUTHORIZED A THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF BONDS THAT 
03:37:08 COULD BE ISSUED BY THAT CORPORATION. 
03:37:27 AND A OF THAT WAY OF BORROWING. 
03:37:35 >> MY OPINION--[UNDISCERNABLE] 
03:37:44 >> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN, I WAS JUST NOT AWARE THAT WE DID HAVE THAT 
03:37:49 AUTHORITY. 
03:37:53 THE BORROWING IS ALMOST ACTIVE WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT WE DIDN'T 
03:37:58 HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REVIEW IT. 
03:38:00 BUT IF I CAN GET THAT CONFIRMED. 
03:38:18 WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD. 
03:38:20 >> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
03:38:22 IPG THERE ARE SOME MEMBERS WHO WOULD LIKE THAT REVIEW SO WE CAN 
03:38:28 UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THAT THE CIVIC COMMISSIONER HAS WITH REGARDS 
03:38:31 TO THOSE BONDS. 
03:38:45 COME A LONG WAY FROM THE PRACTICES, BEGINNING IN 2011. 
03:38:49 >> YES, WE DO AT THE CIVIC FEDERATION AND WE LAID THAT OUT. 
03:38:55 THIS BODY AND MAYOR EMANUEL OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAVE MADE VERY 
03:39:02 SIGNIFICANT IN THE CITY'S FINANCIAL POSITION. 
03:39:04 JUST THE SIZE OF THE BUDGET. 
03:39:15 AND ARE THERE ANY PARTICULAR FINANCIAL PRACTICES ABOUT, SETTING ASIDE 
03:39:18 THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE PENSION. 
03:39:22 WE STILL HAVE MORE TO GO ON PEPSING. 
03:39:25 BUT ARE THERE ANY PARTICULAR PRACTICES THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE 
03:39:28 THAT WE ON THIS COUNCIL, DON'T FALL BACK INTO IN THE COMING YEARS? 
03:39:34 >> WELL, CLEARLY, WHAT WHEN WE'RE POINTING OUT FOR THIS TRANSACTION, 
03:39:39 THIS RESTRUCTURE, NOT PUSHING YOUR DEBT OUT FURTHER BECAUSE IT HAS A 
03:39:45 CLAWS, TAKING THE SAVINGS NOW WHAT YOU'RE LIMITING WHAT FUTURE CITY 
03:39:52 COUNCILS AND WHAT FUTURE MAYORS WILL NEED. 
03:39:58 THE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND 
03:40:03 UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE IMPACT OF THOSE AGREEMENT RIGHT SIDE BEFORE 
03:40:06 THEY'RE APPROVED AND HAVING A PLAN AND A BUDGET ON HOW THOSE ARE 
03:40:10 GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED. 
03:40:14 WE ALSO POINT OUT IN THE REPORT THAT THE CITY IN 2008 WAS THE LAST 
03:40:22 LONG TERM FINANCIAL PLAN THAT THE CITY CAME UP WITH. 
03:40:25 IT'S TIME TO REVISIT THAT. 
03:40:26 THE NEXT MAYOR AND THIS BODY GOING FORWARD MAY WANT TO CONSIDER 
03:40:31 FOLLOWING SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES THAT NOT ONLY PROJECT WHAT 
03:40:36 YOU'RE PLUS ARE GOING TO BE BUT TALK ABOUT SCENARIOS FOR HOW THOSE 
03:40:42 OBLIGATIONS ARE GOING TO BE. 
03:40:43 >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
03:40:49 >> ALDERMAN RIELLY. 
03:40:51 >> THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT. 
03:40:52 GOOD AFTERNOON. 
03:40:53 GOOD AFTERNOON. 
03:40:58 AS ALWAYS WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY TO THE COMMITTEE. 
03:41:02 I DON'T WANT TO DUPLICATE QUESTIONS ASKED BY MY COLLEAGUES, BUT IN 
03:41:07 READING YOUR REPORT, YOU HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND ONE IS THE ON GOING 
03:41:20 FISCAL IMBALANCE. 
03:41:21 YOU TALK ABOUT THE NEXT THREE YEARS. 
03:41:26 YOU PROJECT BEYOND THOSE THREE WHAT THE HOLD COULD BE? 
03:41:31 >> NO WE RELY ON THE CITY'S OWN FORECASTING ON THE REVENUE AND LOOK 
03:41:36 AT THEM. 
03:41:37 I THINK THE FACT THAT THE CITY OWN FINANCIAL FORECAST DOES THAT, I 
03:41:42 BELIEVE THAT IN NEXT YEAR OF 2020, THAT THERE IS ABOUT 251 BILLION 
03:41:53 DOLLARS BUDGETARY SHORTFALL AND IN 2021 IT RISED TO ABOUT 360 MILLION. 
03:42:00 THAT'S ASSUMING THAT EVERYTHING STAYS THE WAY IT IS. 
03:42:02 THAT THERE IS NO SURPRISE AND THAT THERE IS NO WIND FALL OF REVENUE 
03:42:07 OF ADDITIONAL. 
03:42:21 WHILE TLTS NOT DIRECTLY LINKED IT'S BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE ZERO 
03:42:26 BASE BUDGETING, NOT JUST ON COMMODITY BUT PERSONNEL. 
03:42:28 CAN YOU GET INTO A BIT MORE DETAILS. 
03:42:32 YOUR CONCERNS AND RECOMMENDATIONS I KNOW THAT YOU DO REFER TO THE 
03:42:36 GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION BEST PRACTICES. 
03:42:38 I'M TRYING TO LOOK AT T PRACTICALLY HOW WE WOULD APPLY THAT HERE AND 
03:42:43 HOW WE MAY REVISE THE WAY THE BUDGET IS PRESENTED AND ASSOCIATED 
03:42:47 COMMENTS. 
03:42:49 >> RIGHT, SO FULLY INCORPORATING THE COST OF AN EMPLOYEE IS NOT JUST 
03:42:53 THE SALARY OF THE EMPLOYEE. 
03:42:56 THERE ARE THE PENSION BENEFITS TO HELP YOUR BENEFITS AND THE COST OF 
03:43:01 OFFICE SPACE AND THE COST OF EVERY ASSOCIATED OF THE GOVERNMENT AND 
03:43:07 YOU MENTIONED THE GOVERNMENT FINANCE OFFICES ASSOCIATED AS A DE 
03:43:11 TAILED LIST OF HOW YOU CAN BREAK THAT DOWN AND HOW IT CAN MEASURE. 
03:43:17 >> IT DOES REQUIRE SOME ESTIMATE OF HOW THE COST ARE BUT IT GIVES YOU 
03:43:24 THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE COST OF MAINTAINING EMPLOYEE OR HIRING 
03:43:33 NEW EMPLOYEES OR IN THE SERVICE DELIVERY A MAINS OF MEASURE WHETHER 
03:43:38 YOU'RE GETTING THE SAFEST. 
03:43:40 SO THE HARD WOULD BE THE FIRST YEAR, RIGHT. 
03:43:45 AND ESTABLISHMENT AND CALCULATIONS TO COME UP WITH THESE COSTS BUT 
03:43:48 THEN AFTER THAT, WE'LL BE ABLE TO DELAY THE METRICS THAT DETERMINE 
03:43:52 WHETHER OR NOT THE PROGRESS OR WASTED MONEY OR SAVING MONEY. 
03:43:56 >> THAT'S THE GOAL. 
03:44:02 >> AND AGAIN, THE GEFL THEY ALSO, I'LL HAVE TO LOOK MYSELF. 
03:44:07 DO THEY HAVE DOCUMENTS THAT WE CAN REPLICATE HERE? 
03:44:11 >> EXACTLY AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU. 
03:44:16 THEY HAVE AN OFFICER IN CHICAGO. 
03:44:20 I'LL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT. 
03:44:23 >> VERY GOOD. 
03:44:24 AND I ALSO SEE THAT ONE OF YOUR RECOMMENDATION SOUTH SIDE IMPROVING 
03:44:30 ACCOUNTABILITY BY LIVE STREAMING CITY COUNCIL MEETING. 
03:44:33 I KNOW GEORGE BLAKEMOORE IS A BIG FAN. 
03:44:36 >> OTHER GOVERNMENTS PUTTING THIS COUNTY APPROACH LIVE STREAM, NOT 
03:44:41 JUST THEIR COUNCIL MEETINGS BUT BOARD MEETINGS BUT THEIR COMMITTEE 
03:44:46 MEETINGS AND BUDGET HEARINGS. 
03:44:49 BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF CHICAGO MANY ARE NOT ABLE TO ATTEND MEETINGS, 
03:44:54 USING THE TECHNOLOGY THAT ARE VERY LIMITED ALLOWS YOU TO VIDEO TAPE 
03:44:59 AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE LIVE STREAM. 
03:45:01 >> I'M GLAD THAT THAT'S ONE OF YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND MY XLAOEG 
03:45:15 ALDERMAN LAURINO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING THE CITY. 
03:45:19 WE INTRODUCED 44 COSPONSORS THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE BROADCASTING OF 
03:45:22 COMMITTEE HEARINGS AS WELL. 
03:45:24 SO I GUESS, WE'RE READING YOUR MIND BEFORE YOU ASK FOR SUPPORT. 
03:45:29 >> WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT. 
03:45:32 >> HOPEFULLY YOU CAN WORK WITH THAT TO GET THAT APPROVED AND 
03:45:36 IMPLEMENT. 
03:45:38 AND ONE LAST QUESTION, THAT'S RELATED TO THE SALES TAX 
03:45:45 SECURITYIZATION, AGAIN, YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S A GOOD INSTRUMENT, 
03:45:50 YOU'RE RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT HOW IT WOULD BE USED AS PROPOEDS WHICH 
03:45:57 WOULD PUSH OUR DEBT FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD. 
03:45:58 IS THAT ACCURATE? 
03:46:00 >> YES, THAT'S A GOOD TOOL. 
03:46:02 IT'S ONE THAT THE CITY HAS USED EFFECTIVELY. 
03:46:06 YOU REDUCE THE BORROWED COST. 
03:46:10 THE UNINTENDED HERE, HERE WE HAVE INSTEAD OF JUST REFINANCING YOUR 
03:46:16 DEBT, YOU'RE PUSHING, YOUR PUSH IT OUT FURTHER. 
03:46:19 AND SO EVEN THEN, WITH WHAT WE'RE HEARING, WITH THE PROPOSAL, THERE 
03:46:23 WILL BE A NET PRESENT VALUE SAVING, IT WILL NOT BE AS MUCH. 
03:46:28 AND UNTIL WE HEAR AN EXPLANATION FOR WHAT WE WOULD NOT WANT THE CITY 
03:46:35 AND TAXPAYER, WE WOULD STRONGLY MEMBER THAT IT PASS THE TERM. 
03:46:38 >> UNDERSTOOD. 
03:46:39 THAT'S VERY HELPFUL. 
03:46:42 THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS AND THANKS FOR DELIVERING THIS 
03:46:45 REPORT TO CITY COUNCIL. 
03:46:47 >> ALDERMAN TUNNEY. 
03:46:49 >> THANK YOU, MA DPAM PRESIDENT AND WELCOME LAWRENCE. 
03:46:55 WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT, OVERALL DEBT, IN YOUR REPORT, YOU SPECIFICALLY 
03:47:02 TALK ABOUT THE HIGH DEBT FOR THAT HAS REALLY, CONCERNS OF CIVIC 
03:47:12 FEDERATION, AND ALSO CONCERNS TO ALL OF US. 
03:47:14 THERE WAS A CRITICISM OF THE EMANUEL ADMINISTRATION HAS OPINION THE 
03:47:20 OVERALL INCREASE OF DEBT. 
03:47:21 CAN YOU COMMENT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. 
03:47:25 WE TALKED ABOUT PENSION BUT HOW ABOUT NON PERSONNEL RELATED? 
03:47:31 >> I THINK IN FAIRNESS AND LOOKING AT THE TERM OVER THE 8 YEARS, 
03:47:36 MAYOR EMANUEL AND THIS BODY GETS INTEREST FOR IMPROVING THE DEBT 
03:47:41 BURDEN BECAUSE WE ABOLISHED, YOU ABOLISHED SOME REALLY BAD PRACTICE. 
03:47:53 --HAS BORROWING. 
03:47:55 WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS. 
03:47:59 SO FROM THAT STAND POINT, SIGNIFICANT REVENUES HAVE BEEN RACED TO 
03:48:13 ADDRESS THE PENSION MORE THAN EVER. 
03:48:18 BUT WHAT WE'RE TALK ABOUT NOW, WHICH IS FINANCING, TO BRING DO YOU 
03:48:24 WANT DEBT CLAUSE WE'RE NOT GRABING ALL THE SAVINGS BY PUSH ITING OUT 
03:48:28 FURTHER, WE'RE EX TENDING THE DEBT INTO FUTURE CITY COUNCILS WOULD 
03:48:32 HAVE. 
03:48:35 IT'S FROM THE CIVIC FEDERATION PERSPECTIVE, IT'S A FAIRLY POSITIVE 
03:48:40 LOOK AT WHERE WE'RE AT. 
03:48:42 WHAT WE'VE COME FROM AND WHAT HAS BEEN IMPROVED. 
03:48:46 BUT THE CHALLENGE NEXT YEAR IS WHEN YOU FACE THE 250 MILLION DOLLARS 
03:48:51 BUDGET SHORTFALL, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO RESECURIZE THAT YOU 
03:49:00 ALREADY PLEDGED. 
03:49:02 SOME WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR FINANCING FOR A LOPG TIME. 
03:49:07 THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT WILL HAVE TO BE DONE. 
03:49:11 YOU INCORPORATED IN THIS BUDGET AN INCREASE IN FUNDING IN PUBLIC IN 
03:49:17 PUBLIC SAFETY HAS BEEN NEEDED THAT'S PART OF THE CONSENT DEAGREE BUT 
03:49:21 IT'S PRETTY MUCH A ONE-YEAR PLAN FOR FUNDING THAT. 
03:49:24 NEXT YEAR THAT'S WHAT BUILDS INTO THIS STRUCTURE. 
03:49:27 >> AND I'M READING YOUR HIGHLIGHT BETWEEN FISCAL YEAR 08 AND 17, 
03:49:37 PER-CAPITA ROWS 68% TO A PORTION THAT IS BASICALLY FROM 115 TO 3565 
03:49:44 PER PERSON IN DHIK CHICK WHICH IRONICALLY IS LESS POPULAR. 
03:49:47 >> RIGHT. 
03:49:49 WHICH ALSO I AM PEKTS THAT RATIO. 
03:49:50 >> RIGHT. 
03:49:53 >> HON A MORE OF A SUB SET OF TIFF FUNDING, I DON'T RECALL YOUR 
03:50:05 COMMENTARY ON THE RPM DEBT. 
03:50:08 SO WE'RE OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT A STATE COMPONENT IN THE FEDERAL GRANT FOR 
03:50:17 MODERNIZATION OF THE RED PURM. 
03:50:20 WE ESTABLISH THIS FAIRLY LARGE TIP. 
03:50:25 NOW ALBEIT, TOOL FUND ISING KEPT IN TACT. 
03:50:33 DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT ABOUT ABOUT THIS? 
03:50:36 >> I DO. 
03:50:38 I THINK CERTAINLY THE REBUILDING OF THE RED AND PURM LINE IS AN 
03:50:41 IMPORTANT INVESTMENT. 
03:50:43 I THINK THE CITY WAS FACED WITH THE REALITY OF A STATE, THAT WAS 
03:50:49 WITHOUT A CAPITOL BUDGET WITHOUT RESOURCES, IT WAS A TOUGH. 
03:50:53 >> OR OP RATING BUDGET. 
03:50:54 >> RIGHT. 
03:50:56 >> SXIPG THE CITY'S ABILITY AND FOR MY DISCUSSIONS WITH CTA 
03:51:03 PRESIDENT, IS GIVEN SIGNIFICANT CREDIT FOR THIS BODY AND MAYOR 
03:51:09 EMANUEL, TO FUND IT. 
03:51:11 THE ONLY MATCHING SOURCE THAT THE GENERAL A SEM BLEED SEEM WILLING TO 
03:51:18 APPROVE WAS THE INCREMENT TRANSIT. 
03:51:21 I THINK IT WAS WORTH TAKE THE MONEY FROM THE FEDS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT 
03:51:24 GOING TO BE THERE LATER AND IT ALLOWS FOR THE REBUILDING. 
03:51:27 BUT I THINK IT WAS A BIG BIG POLICY SHIFT FOR THE STATE AND CITY. 
03:51:33 WHERE WE BASICALLY DECIDED BECAUSE OF THE DYSFUNCTION OF OUR STATE 
03:51:36 GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE OF OUR LACK OF CAPITOL FUNDING, WE'RE NOW FUNDING 
03:51:44 TRANSIT WHERE WE COULD BE REBUILDING. 
03:51:47 >> AND, OBVIOUSLY, YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY IN THE TIFF 
03:51:53 IS LITERALLY PAYING FOR THE CAPITOL STRUCTURE. 
03:51:55 THERE ARE SO MANY ON THAT, TRANSPORTATION PIECE, EVEN WITHIN CP A. 
03:52:03 WE GOT A CRITICISM IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF SLOW 
03:52:09 ZONES IN THE RED LINE, WE'RE CREATING THIS HUGE TIP. 
03:52:15 BUT THOSE ON THE SOUTHSIDE, SAID WHERE IS THE EXTENSION. 
03:52:20 YOU TALK TO CTA AND YOU HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT THEM RECENTLY, THEY'RE 
03:52:25 ABOUT 10 BILLION ON THAT CAPITOL. 
03:52:28 AND I THINK THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS ALL 
03:52:35 ABOUT TRANSPORTATION AND STRUCTURE AND HELP. 
03:52:37 I'M JUST, YOU KNOW, I KNOW WE'RE GOT THE FEDERAL GRANT AT THE 11th 
03:52:43 HOUR AND WE NEEDED A LOCAL COMPONENT. 
03:52:47 BUT I DON'T REMEMBER TIMING ON THAT ONE. 
03:52:49 >> WELL PART OF IT WAS THE WAY THE MAGIC OF THE SPRINKLE LEGISLATIVE 
03:52:53 WORKED. 
03:52:55 IT HAPPENED SO FAST AS PASTER IMPLEMENTATION ACT. 
03:52:59 THERE WAS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH PUBLIC DISCOURSE AND INPUT. 
03:53:04 BUT AS I SAID, WE SUPPORTED IT. 
03:53:07 WE ENDED UP SUPPORTING IT, ONCE IT WOULD PASS BY THE GENERAL A SEM 
03:53:11 BLEED. 
03:53:13 IT CAME AS A SURPRISE, EVEN THOUGH WE TRIED TO STAY ON TOP OF 
03:53:16 SPRINGFIELD. 
03:53:18 BUT, WHEN YOU'RE PUT IN THAT POSITION WHERE YOU HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY 
03:53:23 TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REBUILD AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE MAPS AND 
03:53:26 THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT THE STATE IS OFFERING, YOU CAN SUM UP A 
03:53:31 LOT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST YEAR. 
03:53:34 THIS SEE HAS BEEN, VERY EFFECTIVE IN GOING TO SPRINGFIELD TO GET SOME 
03:53:40 HELP. 
03:53:42 MOST OF IT WAS NOT GIVEN ON THE FIRST TRY. 
03:53:45 BUT WHETHER IT WAS GETTING MORE MONEY FOR THE CHICAGO PENSION SYSTEM 
03:53:49 WHICH WAS AGAIN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, AUTHORIZING. 
03:53:54 GETTING A TRANSIT ESTABLISHED WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING, WE'RE 
03:53:59 GOING TO FUND THIS, WE'RE GOING TO BACK YOUR TIFF ALONE THROUGH THE 
03:54:02 PROPERTY. 
03:54:03 >> THANK YOU. 
03:54:04 >> DO WE HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS? 
03:54:07 NO? 
03:54:09 OKAY, SIR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY. 
03:54:12 >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
03:54:17 >> OUR NEXT WITNESS RONALD JACKSON. 
03:54:43 IF IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR YOU TO TESTIFY FROM THERE, THAT'S FINE. 
03:54:47 >> IT WILL BE EASIER. 
03:54:49 >> YOU WANT TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF AGAIN FOR THE RECORD. 
03:54:53 >> I'M RONALD, LAST NAME JACKSON,. 
03:55:02 I THANK CHAIRMAN BURKE FOR GIVING ME MY LEAD BECAUSE INSANITY IS 
03:55:07 DOTING SAME THING OVER AND AGAIN. 
03:55:13 THIS GENTLEMAN THAT JUST TESTIFIED HAS BEEN COMING HERE FOR 17 YEARS 
03:55:18 AND REDUNDANT FOR THIS COUNCIL CANNOT COME UP AND ACTUALLY PERPETUATE 
03:55:23 THE NEEDS OF CITY OF CHICAGO. 
03:55:26 IS AN INSULT. 
03:55:28 BUT THEN, TO MAKE SURE THAT I GET TO MY FACT. 
03:55:32 OKAY. 
03:55:33 RIGHT NOW, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BUDGET HEARING AND THE CITY 
03:55:40 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HAS TALKED ABOUT OPIOIDS, THEY TALKED ABOUT ALL 
03:55:46 OF THE DISPARITY OF THE CITY. 
03:55:50 BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO CLOSING THE MENTAL CLINIC AND DESPAIRITY OF 
03:56:02 PEOPLE THAT HURTING. 
03:56:04 WE CAN PEOPLE THAT ARE IN SUFFERING, CANNOT GET HELP. 
03:56:09 BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PRO MOTELING CLINICS. 
03:56:12 WE'RE NOT HIRING PROFESSIONALS TO DO THAT. 
03:56:15 WE ARE OUTSOURCING THEM TO PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS OR POSITIVE ENTITIES 
03:56:21 AND SAYING, WELL LOOK AT AT THE VIOLENCE IN OUR STREET. 
03:56:25 THIS COUNCIL TO BEGIN WITH, CLOSED MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC. 
03:56:34 ALL McCARTINIST SAID HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT HE WAS SIGNING WHEN HE WAS 
03:56:42 SIGNING OFF THE MENTAL CLINIC. 
03:56:45 AND HE AS A CHAIRMAN CANNOT CALL ON MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BECAUSE HE 
03:56:49 NEED TO MAKE SURE THE FINANCE. 
03:56:51 ALWAYS COMING DOWN TO THE FINANCE. 
03:56:53 WE ARE THE TAXPAYERS OF THIS CITY. 
03:56:55 WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY, PUBLIC HEARINGS ON MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. 
03:57:01 WE HAVE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY FUNDING YOU ALL. 
03:57:05 THE IDEA THAT MANY OF YOU WILL CONSIDER YOURSELF DEMOCRAT. 
03:57:11 THE IDEA THAT MANY OF HAVE BEEN ON THIS COUNCIL FOR MORE THAN 20 
03:57:15 YEARS AND STILL THE CITY IS IT FAILING, IS SHOWING THAT THERE IS A 
03:57:19 MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM HERE. 
03:57:21 BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BLAME YOU, I'M GOING BACK TO THREE WEEKS AGO 
03:57:27 THAT TESTIFY THAT KEVIN RAM THE PRESIDENT OF FRATERNAL ORDER OF 
03:57:36 POLICE GAVE TO ILLINOIS GENERAL A SEM BLEED WHERE HE SAYS 13,000 
03:57:39 POLICE IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO BUT ONLY THREE PSYCHOLOGIST THAT 
03:57:50 ACTUALLY GIVE SERVICE TO POLICE. 
03:57:52 BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE HANDING GUNS TO? 
03:57:56 >> NOW, ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR MR. JACKSON? 
03:58:02 >> I DIDN'T EXPECT ANY. 
03:58:08 >> THANK YOU, MR. JACKSON. 
03:58:13 OUR LAST WITNESS IS MR. BLAKEMOORE. 
03:58:33 >> GOOD AFTERNOON, CIVIC FEDERATION LIKE THE GENTLEMAN SAID HAS BEEN

04:00:00 SAY THAT YOU SUPPORT IT?

04:00:16 TECHNOLOGY, BUT ON DEAF EARS.
