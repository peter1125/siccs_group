00:08:59 AND 
00:09:04 MOVED AWAY OUR JOBS AND YOU HAVE SUPPORTED THEM AND YOU ARE SLAVES TO 
00:09:09 THE SYSTEM. YOU ARE SLAVES TO THE SYSTEM. YOU ALL CONTINUE TO LET 
00:09:15 THEM DICTATE YOU, YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE LIE. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO LIE 
00:09:21 IN THE STREETS EVERY SINGLE DAY. WE ARE CONTINUING TO USE THIS TAX 
00:09:27 THIS IDEOLOGY THAT POLICE WILL BRING BLACK PEOPLE FROM THE HOOD UP 
00:09:28 AND

00:10:09 CENTER TO GO TO YET YOU WANT TO GET INSTITUTIONS TO BE BUILT IN THIS 
00:10:16 COMMUNITY THAT WILL PRACTICE ON HOW TO CONTINUE TO KILL US. THAT'S

00:11:03 >> THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MS. HAMPTON. 
00:11:09 >> MY NAME IS MS. HAMPTON A NATIVE CHICAGOAN, A MEMBER THE 
00:11:21 BLACK PARTNERING IN THE COALITION FOR NO COP ACADEMY. I'M DEMANDING 
00:11:27 WITH THE ALDERMAN WITH THE SAME ISSUES AND ALL COUNCIL MEMBERS THAT 
00:11:32 YOU VOTE AGAINST THE ORDINANCE 38 TO STOP THE FUNDING OF THE POLICE 
00:11:38 ACADEMY AND ALL FUTURE FUNDING FOR THE BUILDING OF THE NECESSARY 
00:11:43 POLICE ACADEMY. THE POLICE OFFICERS HAVE CAUSED CORRUPTION AND WE'RE 
00:11:52 NOT AFRAID OF THE POLICE SITUATION BUT THEY'VE MADE THINGS WORSE. AND 
00:11:58 THE POLICE HAVE CALLED AND PEOPLE DIE LIKE WHEN ANTONIO AND BETTY 
00:11:59 JOE. 
00:12:04 I REMEMBER HOW MY FAMILIES WERE IMPACTED. YOU MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL WHEN 
00:12:11 YOU CLOSED DOWN PUBLIC HEALTH CLINICS ON THE WEST SIDE OF CHICAGO 
00:12:18 THEY'RE UNDERFUNDED AND NOT HELPING. I'LL NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE THE 
00:12:24 OPPORTUNITY TO SAY BECAUSE AS A UNIVERSITY STUDENT STOP THE FUNDING 
00:12:32 AND STOP THE ANTI BLACK RACIST. YOU'RE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUDED. STOP 
00:12:39 THE POLICE TO UNDERTAKE THE REGULATION OF THE BROWN AND BLACK ADULTS 
00:12:45 IMPLEMENTING THIS POLICY THIS ACADEMY TO THE COMMUNITY WILL COST MUCH 
00:12:52 LESS TO IMPLEMENT THAN A $95,000 ACADEMY. WE WANT THE RESOURCES 
00:13:01 INSTEAD OF REACTING POLICE OFFICERS WHAT THEY DO THEY OVER 
00:13:02 INCARCERATE 
00:13:05 AND CAUSE HARM. GRANT THIS WORKERS AND JOB PROGRAMS AND OTHER 
00:13:12 DEPARTMENTS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT STAFF CREATING FUNDING FOR 
00:13:13 RESTORATION 
00:13:18 WITHOUT POLICE AND OTHER EFFECTS THAT COME FROM LOOTING IN THE 
00:13:25 COMMUNITIES BY THE CITY. HOW DARE YOU TRY TO BUILD AN ACADEMY WITH 
00:13:31 THE POLICING INITIATIVES AND SUPPORT THE 19-YEAR-OLD BOY THAT WAS 
00:13:38 KILLED. SHAME ON YOU FOR NOT REPRESENTING THE INTEREST OF YOUR 
00:13:42 CONSTITUENTS. YESTERDAY, WE SAW THE POLICE - I SAW BLACK YOUTHS 
00:13:48 WAITING FOR 3 HOURS TO SPEAK - RESPECT OUR VOICES AND HEAR US. THE 
00:13:53 MORE YOU'RE VOTING, THE MORE WE'LL FIGHT TO MAKE SURE WE FOLLOW THE 
00:13:59 ALDERMAN OUT THE DOOR IN 2019. 
00:14:03 >> (CLAPPING.) 
00:14:04 >> STOP PRIORITIZING THE POLICE OVER US. 
00:14:08 (CLAPPING.) 
00:14:10 >> THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MELVIN BAILEY. 
00:14:19 >> GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M MELVIN BAILEY. NOW I TAKE A 
00:14:26 DIFFERENT VIEW FROM THOSE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN HERE. MY VIEW IS IF THE 
00:14:32 COP ACADEMY WILL HIRE YOUNG MEN AND GET THEIR GUNS AND DRUGS OUT OF 
00:14:37 THEIR HANDS, I'M FOR IT. ESPECIALLY THE KIDS I WANT TO SHOW THE FOLKS 
00:14:43 HERE CAN YOU NAME PEOPLE THAT GOT SHOT LAST NIGHT? DO YOU KNOW I'M 
00:14:50 FROM THAT COMMUNITY I LIVED THERE. AND ERIC FISHER GOT SHOT KILLED 
00:14:58 LAST NIGHT. WE WERE THERE GOING TO ERIC FISHER'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. 
00:15:04 WHEN I CALLED THE ALDERMAN, PLEASE COME OUT AND SUPPORT US. IF THIS 
00:15:11 CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS BECAUSE THE PERSON THAT 
00:15:14 SHOT ERIC FISHER WAS A BLACK GUY. AND WE HAVE GOOD AND BAD COPS. 
00:15:22 KNOW THAT THAT CAN CREATE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COMMUNITY THE 
00:15:26 ALDERMAN COMMUNITY I'VE BEEN STAYING IN ALL MY LIFE AND GUNS AND GUNS 
00:15:32 - WE NEED OPPORTUNITY IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. SO I'M FOR IT IF WE'RE 
00:15:37 GOING TO COME TOGETHER AND MAKE SURE WE CAN HOLD EVERY CONTRACTOR 
00:15:42 ACCOUNTABLE. AND THEY'LL HIRE AFRICAN-AMERICAN BOYS AND GIRLS IN THE 
00:15:46 NEIGHBORHOODS, I'M FOR IT BECAUSE I GOT TO MAKE SURE THEY TURN THEIR 
00:15:50 GUNS IN SO WE CAN GET THEM. THEY DON'T HAVE TO THINK THE ONLY WAY FOR 
00:15:59 SURVIVAL I'VE GOT TO GO DOWNTOWN AND ROB SOMEONE. THAT'S THE 
00:16:06 MENTALITY THAT OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE. THOSE ARE ATTITUDES AND THE 
00:16:10 MENTALITY THE KIDS HAVE. IF THIS COP THIS FACILITY WILL HELP TO 
00:16:17 CHANGE, I'M FOR IT. WE NEED THE CHANGE FOR BOYS AND GIRLS IN THE 
00:16:21 NEIGHBORHOOD. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE CONCEPT THAT THINKING BECAUSE I'M 
00:16:27 TELLING YOU TALK TO THEM YOU ALL YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND THEY'RE FOR 
00:16:34 REAL. THEY GOT GUNS RIGHT NOW. WILL YOU HELP ME WITH A JOB? IF YOU 
00:16:42 CAN HELP ME WITH A JOB, YOU KNOW WHAT, I'LL PUT IT DOWN. BUT I WANT 
00:16:49 TO TO MAKE SURE WE ALL - HEY THE $95 MILLION LET'S TALK TO THE MAYOR 
00:16:55 TO REACH ALL OUR GOAL BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE COMMUNITY, THE 
00:17:00 COMMUNITY IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO I WAS BORN AND RAISED AND EVERY TIME 
00:17:07 SOMEONE GETS SHOT, THEY KNOCK ON MY DOOR. YOU HAVE A MISSION. WE CAN 
00:17:13 AGREE TO DISAGREE. 
00:17:16 >> THANK YOU. 
00:17:17 >> THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MR. GEORGE BLAKMORE. 
00:17:24 >> GOOD AFTERNOON TO OUR CITIZENS. AND BE RESPECTFUL. 
00:17:47 >> NO WAY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. GOD HAS GIVEN BLACK PEOPLE 
00:17:53 EVERYTHING THEY NEED ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IT USED WHAT IS GIVEN TO 
00:17:59 THEM. NOW I PARDON ME THEY'LL NOT TAKE JOBS, AND GET TO - IT WILL NOT 
00:18:12 BE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR THAT COMMUNITY. THEIR - AND YOU GOING TO 
00:18:22 - LESS 0 THAN. ARE YOU ADVOCATING TO BE THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR? 
00:18:27 >> OVER THE WHOLE PROCESS. YOU FIND OUT WITH AN ONE OF THE 
00:18:54 REQUIREMENT FOR THE CHICAGO POLICE YOU CAN CAME FROM CHINESE OR 
00:18:55 RUSSIA 
00:19:00 OR MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION AND BE A CHICAGO POLICEMAN. CHANGE THAT 
00:19:06 ON YOUR APPLICATION. ALL POLICEMEN WILL BE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED 
00:19:13 STATES OF AMERICA AND YOU KNOW, I ADVOCATE FOR CITIZENS. I'M AGAINST 
00:19:20 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT AND AGAINST THE LAW. SO THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT 
00:19:26 HERE. I'M NOT HERE TO SAY NO GROUP OF MY OWN AND - BUT SOME OF YOU 
00:19:41 SAY THEY'LL NOT BE HERE. SOME OF THEM BEEN HERE 20 YEARS, 10 YEARS, 
00:19:49 8 YEARS 20 YEARS SHOW ME, YOU GOT POWER THEY'LL NOT BE SITTING HERE 
00:19:57 AND I'LL NOT COME HERE. THIS IS A BECAUSE OF CORRUPTION IN THE CITY.

00:30:52 UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION. I UNDERSTAND DID FRUSTRATION WITH THE 
00:30:57 POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE BRUTAL I'VE STUDIED SAT IN ON MANY MEETINGS 
00:31:05 I'M A BUSINESS OWNER AND CONCERNED. I'M UNDERSTANDING THE FRUSTRATION 
00:31:09 AND KNOW THAT WE NEED MORE 0 POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY AND THINGS 
00:31:17 EXPEDITIOUSLY DONE WITH THIS OUR BROWN AND BLACK KIDS ARE EFFECTED. 
00:31:22 BECAUSE WE CAN'T BLAME EVERYTHING ON THE POLICE. WE HAVE TO TAKE 
00:31:28 ACCOUNTABILITY OAR OUR LACK OF JUDGMENT IN OUR COMMUNITY. THAT BEING 
00:31:35 SAID, UNDERSTAND THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH IS NEEDED MORE SO AND IN 
00:31:42 CONJUNCTION WITH EDUCATION. WHAT IS ECONOMIC GROWTH IF YOU'RE PUTTING 
00:31:47 A $95 MILLION ANY TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT IN A BLIGHTED AREA THAT WILL 
00:31:54 ATTRACT BUSINESSES. AND ATTRACT EVEN MORE RESIDENT THAT LIVE WITHIN 
00:32:00 THE COMMUNITY AND THE RIOTS WILL FEEL SAFE. SO WHEN YOU HAVE A 
00:32:05 DEVELOPMENT AND SMALL BUSINESS IS RISE UP FOR THE DEVELOPMENT 
00:32:14 54 PERCENT OF THE HIRING IS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND I'M IN SUPPORT OF 
00:32:19 ANYTHING THAT COMMENTS ARE LIMITED TO 2 MINUTES PER SPEAKER. 
00:32:20 >> COMMENTS SO BRING JOBS. HOWEVER, I WOULD CHALLENGE THE 
00:32:25 CITY COUNCIL THAT THERE MUST BE A LONG TIME THINK COMMUNITY BENEFIT 
00:32:26 OF 
00:32:30 THE PROJECT HE AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING IN OUR COMMUNITY JUST LIKE 
00:32:31 IN 
00:32:34 THE WALL STREET WAS BUILT WE ASKED FOR THE BROWN AND BLACK BECAUSE WE

01:09:01 >> THANK YOU SO MUCH MR. PRESIDENT, AND WANT TO MAKE ONE 
01:09:06 THING CLEAR I'M NOT HEAR TO SUPPORT MY COLLEAGUES FOR A MEASURE THAT 
01:09:13 LOMBARD STREET $49 MILLION FOR THE ACADEMY. WE ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE 
01:09:20 WORKING CHICAGOANS ARE RAISING THEIR VOICES. THEY ARE RAISING THEIR 
01:09:27 VOICES FOR CITY COUNCIL THAT ENGAGES IN DEMOCRATIC DEBATE FOR PUBLIC 
01:09:34 FUND AND MEANINGFUL MEASURES AND SO THAT POLICE VIOLENCE IN THE 
01:09:40 NEIGHBORHOOD 
01:09:41 (CLAPPING.) 
01:09:42 THE CITY OF CHICAGO SPENDS 300 PERCENT MORE ON POLICING THAN ON 
01:09:43 FAMILY 
01:09:50 AND SUPPORT SERVICES AND PUBLIC HEALTH. 
01:09:53 >> TRAFFIC SAFETY AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YOU'RE POOR AND 
01:09:59 WORKING-CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS ARE SUFFERED INCREASE IN ADMINISTRATION. 
01:10:05 POLICE VIOLENCE HAS COST SHIA $662 MILLION IN ESTIMATE IN 2004 THAT'S 
01:10:15 ON TOP OF $4 MILLION PER DAY $5 BILLION PER YEAR. WE SPEND ON POLICE. 
01:10:23 CHICAGO SPENDS 40 PERCENT OF OUR BUDGET. POINT ONE THAT PERIODS OF 
01:10:28 TIME ON HOMELESSNESS SERVICES. AND OTHERS PROGRAMS. NOW I READ A 
01:10:34 BUNCH OF NUMBERS ABOUT MONEY. BUT I WANT TO SAY IN SUPPORT POLICE 
01:10:41 VIOLENCE AND RACIST POLICING HAS COST THE LIVES OF SONS AND DAUGHTER 
01:10:48 AND LIKE MCDONALD AND OTHERS. THE LAW FOR THEM THE HARM CAUSED BY 
01:10:56 POLICE VIOLENCE IS NOT CAN BE QUANTIFIED BY MY VOTE. SO WHAT IS CLEAR 
01:11:05 OUR CITY AND COUNTY POLICE DEPARTMENT IS NOT BACKING THE LOVING IT IS 
01:11:09 LACKING ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT. ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT 
01:11:14 THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED BY THE CIVILIAN ACCOUNTABILITY. THE COMES WITH 
01:11:21 THE SUPPORT OF A 50 THOUSAND POLICE DECKIC FOLKS. A LOT OF THIS SAID 
01:11:30 ON THE DOJ REPORT BUT THAT REPORT HAS 88 THOUSAND PLUS WORDS. 
01:11:38 REFERENCING THE TRAINING FACILITY MAKE UP LESS THAN POINT ZERO ONE 
01:11:45 PERCENT. AND PLAIN THAT FACILITY WILL IMPLEMENT THE DEPARTMENT OF 
01:11:51 JUSTICE RECOMMENDS GIVE IN ADMINISTRATION IS WILL PLANNING THIS 
01:11:54 FACILITY BEFORE THIS BUSINESS. AND THAT VERY THING THAT THE 
01:12:05 ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT MUST BE PRIORITIZED BEFORE 
01:12:06 A 
01:12:11 TRAINING FACILITY. YOU'RE WORKING FAMILIES ARE NOT - THEY'RE CRYING 
01:12:19 OUT FOR DEMOCRATIC PROPOSALS AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
01:12:24 JUSTICE. I AGREE WITH THE BLACK YOUTH AND THE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS 
01:12:30 OF ACCORDINGLY THAT BE RAISING THEIR VOICES THE $95 MILLION WILL COST 
01:12:37 TO BUILD THIS FACILITY SHOULD BE INVESTED IN JOBS AND HEALTH & HUMAN 
01:12:42 SERVICES IN OUR COMMUNITY. 
01:12:45 >> (CLAPPING.) 
01:12:48 >> THERE IS ALSO A MATTER WE'RE NOT DOUG THIS THE CITY HALL 
01:12:56 USE THIS A ANCHORS AND IN THE RICHARD MEMORIAL USED A PUBLIC 
01:12:57 BUILDING. 
01:13:05 WE SEE HOW THE MAYOR USING THE CHICAGO, ILLINOIS TO PLACE A RACIAL 
01:13:12 BARRIER BETWEEN QUOTE QUOTED A NEARBY CONCENTRATION AND THE COPS 
01:13:20 AMENDMENT WAS BUILT IN 1976 AND BUILDINGS WERE BURNED DOWN DURING THE 
01:13:27 ASSASSINATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING AND THAT WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. 
01:13:32 SOME TODAY CALL THE WEST SIDE. THE EXISTING COP ACADEMY IS 
01:13:38 GENTRIFYING IT APPEARS THIS ADMINISTRATION NOW SEEKS TO BUILD AN 
01:13:45 ACADEMY WEST. AND ALLOWING THE MAYOR TO SELL THE LAND IN THE EXISTING 
01:13:52 ACADEMY CONNECTED TO BOTH. THE LAST THING THE LACKING THEIR RIGHT TO 
01:14:02 STIFF IN OPPOSITION. AND WEDNESDAY COUNCIL MEETING WE SPEND 2 HOURS 
01:14:08 ON HONORARY REDS. THIS IS IMPORTANT WE HONOR OUR RIOTS RESIDENTS BUT 
01:14:16 WE'RE NOT PREPARED ON 5 SECONDS ON THE LACK OF FOUNDATION OF THIS 
01:14:21 MONEY AND NOT SPENDING ANY TIME ON DEBATE. OR RENOVATING AND 
01:14:29 ADDRESSING THE FACILITY SHOULD TAKE PREPONDERANCE OR PREPONDERANCE 
01:14:37 OVER AND OVER INVESTING IN THE OPENING OF OUR SCHOOLS AND BUILDING IN 
01:14:42 THE COMMUNITY. SO I WANT TO SAY THAT TODAY, CHIEF GONZALES ARE 
01:14:48 RAISING THEIR VOICES FOR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ADDRESSING POVERTY AND 
01:14:54 THEY'RE RAISING THEIR VOICES FOR THE BLACK COULDN'T BE WITH US NO 
01:15:01 POLICING AND NO PLACE THAT IS IS FOR CHIEF GONZALES. 
01:15:05 >> YES. THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS INVESTING ON THE WEDDING AND, 
01:15:10 YES WE STAND FOR THE MANY AND NOT THE FEW. 
01:15:15 (CLAPPING.) 
01:15:18 DESPITE THE DAY WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDING, OUR 
01:15:23 MOVEMENT IS GROWING. OUR FIGHT TO PUT THE WORKING-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD 
01:15:31 IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO FIRST. OUR FIGHT TO END RACISM IN THE CITY IS 
01:15:36 FAR FROM OVER. THIS IS IT HAS TO BE DONE. THANK YOU. 
01:15:43 >> (YELLING). 
01:15:44 >> ALDERMAN JOSEPH MOORE. 
01:15:48 >> (GAVEL.) 
01:16:01 >> (YELLING.) 
01:16:06 >> ALDERMAN. 
01:16:35 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. I WANT TO START MY REMARKS BY 
01:16:42 THE POINT OF THE AGREEMENT WITH ALDERMAN RAMIREZ-ROSA AND PEOPLE IN 
01:16:50 THE GALLERY. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS INDEED A SERIOUS FORUM. 
01:16:59 ALDERMAN RAMIREZ-ROSA POINTED OUT THAT OVER $600,000 ARE BEING SPENT 
01:17:06 ON HEALTHCARE WAS SPENT IN ESTIMATES TO THE RESULT OF POLICING 
01:17:13 MISCONDUCT. I'VE BANG SAYING THAT LONG BEFORE THE MCDONALD CASE THAT 
01:17:20 THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS IN SERIOUS NEED OF REFORM. THAT IS THE OBAMA 
01:17:28 JUSTIFIES DEPARTMENT. AND THE POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY TASK FORCE AND 
01:17:35 ALSO HAD A SAD OCCASION. AND THE OBAMA JUSTICE DEPARTMENT NEEDED TO 
01:17:44 BE MORE OTHER ACCOUNTABILITY, MORE OVERSIGHT AND THE ISSUE THIS BODY 
01:17:51 IS WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. THE OBAMA JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE 
01:17:55 ACCOUNTABILITY TASK FORCE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE CRYING NEED FOR 
01:18:01 IMPROVED TRAINING. IF YOU DIDN'T PROVING IMPROVE THE TRAINING OF THE 
01:18:06 POLICE OFFICERS TEACH THEM HOW TO REACT IN SITUATIONS WITH 
01:18:07 DEESCLATION 
01:18:14 TACTICS RATHER THAN OTHER TACTICS WE HAVE THE SAME - EXCUSE ME - 
01:18:21 MA'AM. 
01:18:27 >> (SOMEONE IS TALKING.) 
01:18:33 >> EXCUSE ME - MA'AM. 
01:18:36 >> (CLAPPING.) 
01:18:43 >> NO MORE - CHANTING, CHANTING. 
01:18:48 >> (GAVEL.) 
01:18:51 >> OKAY. JOE. 
01:18:52 >> ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, I CERTAINLY AM POLLINATED WHEN YOU 
01:19:02 SPOKE AND LISTENED WITH ALDERMAN SPOKE. PLEASE GIVE ME THE SAME 
01:19:11 COURTESY AND MAYBE I'LL LEARN SOMETHING AND LEARN FROM YOU AS WELL 
01:19:12 AS. 
01:19:19 THERE IS COLLECTIVE READING OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. ALLOW ME TO 
01:19:27 QUOTE FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ON PACKAGES IS 03 AND 4 OF THIS 
01:19:35 REPORT THE OBAMA JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAID AS THE OFFICE OF SMALL 
01:19:39 BUSINESS. THE TRAINING FACILITIES ARE IN DISREPAIR AND MADE IF YOU 
01:19:46 UPGRADES AFTER BUILT IN 1976. DRAINING IS ALWAYS AND THERE IS A 
01:19:53 BREAKDOWN. THIS TRAINING IS DIFFICULT AND PROBABILITY DANGEROUS AND 
01:20:02 MORE UPKEEP FOR THOSE WHO WORK AND TRAIN AND TO THE PUBLIC THE 
01:20:08 TRAINING IS NEEDS TO BE VALUED. THE JUSTIFIES DEPARTMENT SAID THAT 
01:20:14 QUOTE, THE CURRENT FACILITIES USED ARE INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE 
01:20:20 TRAINING NEEDS OF A DEPARTMENT. SO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS IN 
01:20:26 SUPPORT OF THIS IS FORTHCOMING INCLUDING A LACK OF AN OUTDOOR 
01:20:27 SHOOTING 
01:20:33 RANGE AND GROUNDS AND NOT BUILDING FOR SCENARIO BASED TRAINING. 
01:20:40 >> IT - 
01:20:42 >> (INTERRUPTION.) 
01:20:47 >> (CLAPPING.) 
01:20:53 >> THEY FIND IF FIND ONE OF THE SCENARIO TRAINING 
01:20:58 BUILDINGS, WHICH IS TRAINING IS EXECUTED TO BE DANGEROUS. WE HAVE A 
01:21:13 LACK OF ADEQUATE SAFETY PROTOCOL. 
01:21:19 >> (CLAPPING.) 
01:21:20 >> IT NOTED IN THE REPORT THAT SECOND FACILITY FOR TRAINING 
01:21:24 IS ON A PUBLIC STREET CLOSE TO THINK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND QUOTE 
01:21:30 CONDUCTING SCENARIO TRAINING IS SUCH IN SUCH A SETTING PUTS THE 
01:21:31 PUBLIC 
01:21:38 AT RISK. THIS REPORT FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WAS ECHOED IN THE 
01:21:44 POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY TASK REPORT THE PHYSICAL SPACE IS INNER 
01:21:45 ADEQUATE 
01:21:52 TO MEET FUTURE NEEDS. THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE THAT HOUSES THE ACADEMY 
01:21:58 IS CAN'T ACCOMMODATE LET ALONE THE TRAINING THAT IS NECESSARY OR MAKE 
01:22:08 REAL CULTURAL CHANGE. THE CONSTRAINT OF THE IMPACT WILL AFFECT THE 
01:22:15 TRAIN AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS WE'VE DISCUSSED WITH THE OBAMA 
01:22:20 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND OUR OWN POLICE ACADEMY TASK FORCE INDICATES A 
01:22:28 NEW FACILITY IS NECESSARY. WE SEE THE PARTS OF REPORT WE AGREE WITH 
01:22:35 AND THOSE ARE THE RECOMMENDATIONS. I BELIEVE OR THESE RECOMMENDS ARE 
01:22:44 SOUND AND THE MAJORITY OF THIS COUNCIL THIS THEIR SOUND. I BELIEVE 
01:22:49 THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS BUILDING IN BETTER 
01:22:50 TRAINING 
01:22:55 IS NECESSARY. THE STATES PRESENTS A FALSE CHOICE. THEY SAY WE SPEND 
01:23:06 THE MONEY ON SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION OR ON IMPROVED POLICE TRAINING. WE 
01:23:12 DIDN'T HAVE THAT LUXURY WE NEED THEM BOTH. THAT'S WHY THIS BUDGET 
01:23:20 RULES FOR $6 MILLION FOR THE YOUTH PROGRAMS AND THIS IS WHAT WE'VE 
01:23:26 SPENT A 4 YEARS. THAT'S WHY THE BOARD OF EDUCATION SPENT $1 MILLION 
01:23:32 IN INCREMENT FINANCING TO IMPROVE THAT. WE ARE TRYING TO DO BOTH YOU 
01:23:38 CAN'T DID ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER WE NEED TRAINED POLICE OFFICERS AND 
01:23:46 FACILITY IF WE'RE GOING TO STOP THIS VISIBLE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE IN THE 
01:23:54 CITY. I URGE YOU THIS COUNCIL TO IGNORE THE FEW LOUD VOICES AND 
01:24:00 SUPPORT THE TRAINING FACILITY FOR OUR POLICE OFFICERS AND CITIZENS. 
01:24:05 >> 0 ALDERMAN KING AND THEN ALDERMAN - 
01:24:12 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:24:16 >> THIS IS NOT AN EASY DECISION. NOT BLACK AND WHITE NO 
01:24:25 DECISIONS ARE THEIR GRAY AND DIFFICULTY WILL SO TRUE LEADERSHIP I 
01:24:32 AGREE WITH MY MOSTLY YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS THAT MORE 
01:24:33 INVESTMENT 
01:24:39 AND SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC HEALTH MIGHT BE A BETTER USE OF RESOURCES. LET 
01:24:46 ME FINISH? 
01:24:47 >> I SAY SO THE DISPROPORTIONATE LOGOS IT PLAGIARIZING OUR 
01:24:56 COMMUNITY AND UNDERSTAND THE IDEA TO LOCATE THE POLICE ACADEMY ON THE 
01:25:02 WEST SIDE AND THE RESOURCES WILL BRING JOBS AND RETAIL, AND 
01:25:07 REVITALIZATION. I CAN ALSO SEE HOW BROWN AND BLACK FOLKS MIGHT SEE 
01:25:13 THE TIMING OF THIS ACADEMY AS REWARDING THE POLICE WITH A NEW 
01:25:19 FACILITY, IN THE FACE OF A DOJ REPORT. HOWEVER, I SEE THIS NEW 
01:25:30 ACADEMY AS REWARDING THE COMMUNITY. AND AS A CLEAR DECLARATION TO THE 
01:25:35 POLICE THEY HAVE TO TRAIN BETTER AND THEY HAVE TO DO BETTER 
01:25:41 PARTICULARLY IN THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. I WAS DISHEARTENED BY THE 
01:25:47 LEADERSHIP IN THE F O P DEMONIZING THE BLACK LIVES MATTER. I SEE WAS 
01:25:55 SHINING A LIGHT ON BROWN AND BLACK THERE IS A SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION 
01:26:03 BECAUSE OF A LONG HISTORY FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT TECHNICAL INTERTWINED 
01:26:06 WORKPLACE THE FABRIC OF THE DEPARTMENT AND MOST OF DEPARTMENT. THE 
01:26:11 PROBLEM WITH THE POLICE DEVELOPMENT LIKE THE ABUSE IN THE ARCHDIOCESE 
01:26:17 THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHEN WE HOLD TO A HIGHER STANDARD 78 WE COUNT ON 
01:26:24 FOR PROTECTING US. THE INI DIDN'T SAY NOT LOST ON MY IN THE REQUESTS 
01:26:31 I GOT MOSTLY IF THE PARENT OF EVERY COMMUNITY MEETING I REPRESENT 
01:26:32 THAT 
01:26:38 MORE POLICE BE IN THE STREETS. THOSE ARE FACTS NOT THEY WANT THEIR 
01:26:46 PRESENTS. THEY 79 THEIR PROTECTION. THEY WANT GOOD COMMUNITY 
01:26:51 POLICING. AND THAT IDEA, SHOULDN'T BE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE GOOD 
01:27:00 COMMUNITY POLICING. I GET IN EVERY MEETING I URGE YOU YOU ALL TO 
01:27:05 COME. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT PERSPECTIVE AS DIMINISHED THE BROWN AND 
01:27:12 BLACK AND THAT HAS. WELL MAINLY THE BLACK. THE ONE WE NEED ANOTHER 
01:27:17 THAT PARTICULAR TIME, THAT PRESERVATION AND REALITY OF POLICING HAVE 
01:27:23 TO CHANGE. BUILDING A NEW TRAINING FACILITY WAS ONE OF THE DOJ 
01:27:30 RECOMMENDED TO MAKE THAT BETTER IN THE CITY. AND I WILL TAKE THE 
01:27:36 LIBERTY OF SAYING NOT ONE OF THE PRIORITIES. I CALL ON EVERY SINGLE 
01:27:41 ONE OF YOU TO MAKE SURE THE MAJORITY OF THE DOJ RECOMMENDATIONS ARE 
01:27:45 PUT INTO PLACE BEFORE THIS BUILDING IS BUILT. WE ALSO NEED TO PUT 
01:27:52 MOST OF RESOURCES INTO GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS, JOBS, AND MENTAL 
01:27:57 HEALTH. THOSE SHOULD BE THE PRIORITIES GOING FORWARD. AND IS NOT 
01:28:02 THAT DIFFICULT. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO 
01:28:07 HAVE ALL MONEY I'LL BE THE FIRST TO SAY WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE THAT. I 
01:28:17 DO NOT THINK THAT IS AN EITHER OR I WANT TO SEE MORE BROWN AND BLACK 
01:28:27 CROSS-OUTS ON THE WEST SIDE. TO SHIFT THE PARADIGM AND PERCEPTION YOU 
01:28:33 HAVE SHOULD BE THERE TO PROTECT THEM NOT AN AND OR LIKE THE 
01:28:43 ADMINISTRATION SAYS THAT IS NOT A ANNOUNCE. AND WE HAVE TO SHOW UP AS 
01:28:48 LEADERS IN A DIFFICULT TIME. I APPRECIATE THE YOUNG PEOPLE 
01:28:52 HERE. I DO. I APPRECIATE YOUR VOICES, I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO MAKE 
01:28:57 THEM HORDE. I HOPE MORE IMPORTANTLY YOU GET TO THE POLLS. AND VOTE. 
01:29:05 IF THIS IS THE CASE SO BE IT. I'M HERE TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY IF THEY 
01:29:12 DON'T SEE THAT THAT BENEFITS THEM I'M NOT AFRAID AND NOT AFRAID TO 
01:29:18 MAKE A DECISION TODAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. 
01:29:20 >> ALDERMAN ERVIN. 
01:29:23 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
01:29:26 >> BEFORE I CONCLUDE I WANT TO SEE A NOTE FROM THE CHAIRMAN 
01:29:36 SHOULD A NOTE TO I'M NOT ABLE TO ATTEND THE MEETING I WANT TO REPORT 
01:29:43 ON THE SUPPORT FOR THE CITY COUNCIL CONSIDERATION TO PRECEDES FOR THE

01:30:07 THE 11TH DISTRICT. I'VE LIVED IN THE 11TH DISTRICT FOR THE LAST 20 
01:30:14 ODD YEARS AND SEEN FOLKS SHOT AND KILLED. I'VE SEEN FOLKS DO ALL 
01:30:23 KINDS OF STUFF. IN THE 11TH DISTRICT ON THE WEST SIDE OF CHICAGO. 
01:30:29 THIS FACILITY NOT ONLY HELPS TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE CHALLENGES, 
01:30:30 THAT 
01:30:37 OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT FACES, BUT IT ALSO BRINGS ALL OFFICES NOT JUST 
01:30:45 POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS AND PARAMEDICS IN AND OUT OF A 
01:30:50 COMMUNITY MANY HAS VIOLENCE AND HAS DONE THAT THIS YEAR, THE LAST 
01:30:55 40 YEARS. AND CHALLENGE AND OTHER THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE? 
01:31:00 >> YES. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP. WHEN THE GAS 
01:31:07 STATION WHEN FOR THE CITY OF CHICAGO WAS BUILT THREE OR FOUR BLOCKS 
01:31:08 TO 
01:31:13 STABILIZE BUSINESSES. MY NEIGHBORS TO THE TO THE NORTH AND I'M SICK 
01:31:22 AND TIRED OF FOLKS THAT LIVE THAT LIVE IN OTHER COMMUNITY IT WANT TO 
01:31:28 COME TO THE WEST SIDE TO TELL US HOW TO LIVE.

01:31:40 LEFT THEM THERE TO I DON'T FORGET. THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE TIME FORM 
01:31:51 CHANGES FOR OUR CHILDREN AND HAVE TO MAKE CHANGE FOR OUR SENIORS.
