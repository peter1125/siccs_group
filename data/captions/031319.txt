00:05:53 >> WELL, I HEAR THE SUPPORT OF LAURIE 
00:06:00 LIGHT FOOT FOR MAYOR AND SOME KIND OF A DOG 
00:06:06 WHISTLE. SO BECAUSE THINGS ARE WRONG WE SPEN 
00:06:10 OVER $1 MILLION FOR A DEFENSE FUND. THIS IS 
00:06:15 NOT COMMON SENSE JUST SAYING A WASTE OF 
00:06:18 TAXPAYERS DOLLARS. AND THE SAME BODY COULDN' 
00:06:22 FIND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE 
00:06:24 COUNCIL - THAT WAS YESTERDAY - COULDN'T FIND 
00:06:27 ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT A 
00:06:29 $1.2 MILLION FOR THAT. BEYOND RIDICULOUS. 
00:06:36 VERY SOON THE PENSION BILLS WILL COME DUE WIT 
00:06:41 IN THE LOANS. 8 YEARS THE MAYOR HAS BEEN IN 
00:06:44 OFFICE AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE DUE NEXT 
00:06:48 YEAR AND NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE ABOUT IT. I 
00:06:50 THINK MANY OF US SPEND - SPENT A LOT OF TIME

00:06:56 BEFORE THAT MAYOR DAILY AND WAKE UP EVERYDAY 
00:07:01 WONDERING HOW CAN I ENRICH MYSELF OR FURTHER

00:07:21 OUTNUMBER THE PERCENTAGE OF POLICE OFFICERS O 
00:07:24 POLICE. YOU, YOU PREFER TO VILIFY THE POLICE 
00:07:27 AND HAVEN'T GOTTEN YOUR OWN HOUSE IN ORDER. 
00:07:31 THE ETHICS MEETING YESTERDAY WAS A JOKE. THE 
00:07:36 SIMPLE SOLUTION A TERM LIMIT FOR THE MAYOR AN 
00:07:39 COUNCIL MEMBERS - TWO TERM LIMITS. RONALD 
00:07:45 REAGAN ONCE FAMOUSLY ASKED: "ARE YOU BETTER 
00:07:48 OFF NOW THEN 4 YEARS AGO?" "ARE YOU BETTER 
00:07:52 OFF 8 YEARS AGO?" THE ANSWER CLEARLY, NO. 
00:07:55 MR. MAYOR YOU SPENT 8 YEARS FOR THE POLITICAL 
00:07:58 ALLIES TO MAKE THEM RICH AND KICKED THE CAN

01:40:22 THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF 
01:40:25 THOSE DOORS RIGHT NOW. (YELLING.) 
01:40:31 >> I COUNT APPROXIMATELY 40 OR 50 SEATS

01:40:40 PUBLIC WE'LL LET - THE PEOPLE 
01:40:45 IN. 
01:40:46 >> I THINK THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS WE 
01:40:47 NEED TO TALK ABOUT ONE 
01:40:49 IS ALDERMAN THERE'S A LOT OF 
01:40:50 CONVERSATION WHAT PROGRESSIVE MEANS. NOW 
01:40:54 A STOP SIGN I'M NOT GOING TO NO, BUT IF 
01:40:55 WE SPEND OVER $90,000 AND MAKE 
01:41:08 DECISIONS ABOUT THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND 
01:41:09 POLICE DEPARTMENT IN THE CITY OF 
01:41:11 CHICAGO NOT SOMETHING WE SHOULD DEFER 
01:41:12 TO ONE PERSON WE WERE ELECTED AS 
01:41:16 A BODY OF 50 FOR THE ENTIRE BODY OF 
01:41:17 CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SO 
01:41:24 ALDERMEN'S PROGRESSIVE. THE REALITY 
01:41:25 THIS EFFECTS THE ENTIRE CITY THAT 
01:41:31 ALL OF US BE ABLE TO BE PART OF THE 
01:41:32 CONVERSATION. SO WHAT IS IT I 
01:41:36 WANT TO WEIGH IN ON? THE RECENT VOTE 
01:41:37 THE BEST WAY TO HAVE PUBLIC 
01:41:41 SAFETY IS INVESTING IN SCHOOL PROGRAMS 
01:41:42 AND JOBS AND MENTAL HEALTH. 
01:41:50 (YELLING). 
01:41:51 >> SOMETHING IN COUNCIL HAS 
01:41:52 CONSISTENTLY FAILED. WE CLOSED 
01:41:56 50 PUBLIC SCHOOLS WE CLOSED MENTAL 
01:41:57 HEALTH CLINICS WE WERE TOLD NOT 
01:42:00 ENOUGH MONEY TO INVEST IN OUR 
01:42:01 NEIGHBORHOOD TO INVEST IN THE 
01:42:05 WORKING-CLASS NOW WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE

01:42:10 BASIC SUPPLIES THEIR WORK IN 
01:42:17 IRAQ IN THE WAY THEY CATER AND NOW 
01:42:18 WE'RE VOTING TO GIVE THAT CORRUPT 
01:42:26 ENTITY MONEY. MONEY THAT INSTEAD OF 
01:42:27 GOES TO MEANINGFUL PUBLIC SAFETY.

01:42:34 MEASURE WILL PASS TODAY BUT II 
01:42:41 REGISTRATION MY OPPOSITION AND TWO 
01:42:42 CANDIDATES WILL BE OUR MAYOR IN

01:51:21 OF ALL, ANYONE KNOWS ME SOMETHING THAT 
01:51:22 IS NOT GOOD FOR THE CITY I WILL 
01:51:27 BE AGAINST IT. ONE OF THE SITUATIONS IT 
01:51:28 WAS GREAT. AS YOU SAID IN 
01:51:36 BRIEFING THIS IS FOR THE PEOPLE. THIS 
01:51:37 BODY MAKES THE DECISIONS WHAT 
01:51:41 WAS RIGHT FOR THIS CITY. THEY'VE BEEN 
01:51:42 MANY CASES ON SMALLER PROJECTS 
01:51:46 NOT IMPORTANT TO MY WARD THAT WE SAID 
01:51:47 THAT WARD HAS COME TO YOU AND 
01:51:52 LET THEM VOTE ON HER THEY ELECTED HIS 
01:51:53 OR HER THIS SITUATION THE POLICE 
01:52:02 STATUS AND EVERYONE LICENSES. I USED TO 
01:52:03 GET THE COUNCIL MEMBERS TO 
01:52:08 SAY LET THEM VOTE I DIDN'T HEAR THAT I 
01:52:09 HEARD WE GOT TO LISTEN AND WE 
01:52:14 LISTENED THIS IS NOT AN AUTOMATIC 
01:52:15 PRO-ACTIVE VOTE. THE OTHER THING 
01:52:22 THAT ALDERMAN SAID I'LL NOT REPEAT IT 
01:52:23 IT DOES MATTER YOU KNOW WHAT I'M 
01:52:30 AND THE FACT THEY WERE RE-ELECTED THE 
01:52:31 FACT STATE REPRESENTATIVES ARE 
01:52:36 STILL WITH THEM ALL THAT DOES THOSE ARE 
01:52:37 THE VOICES OF PEOPLE CAST 
01:52:43 THEIR VOTE THIS MATTERS. AND THE OTHER 
01:52:44 THING I WAS EXISTED WHERE YOU 
01:52:48 AGREE OR DISAGREE WHETHER YOU AGREE 
01:52:49 WITH THEM I SAY GIVE THEM A SEAT 
01:52:55 AT THE TABLE THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ISSUE 
01:52:56 AND ESPECIALLY LASTS LADY FROM 
01:53:00 THE 17 WARD CAME TO SPEAK WITH ME NOT 
01:53:01 ONLY THE ISSUE DO THROW 
01:53:08 EVERYTHING OUT. OTHERWISE WILL CONTINUE 
01:53:09 A CYCLE OF GETTING RID OF 
01:53:15 PEOPLE AND SO AS WE ARE HERE YOU CAME 
01:53:16 OUT AND VOICED YOUR CONCERNS 
01:53:22 DON'T STOP WITH THAT ONE ISSUE. WE HAVE 
01:53:23 TO HAVE A CONSENSUS COMING UP 
01:53:28 YOU HAVE TO GO DOOR TO DOOR BECAUSE WE 
01:53:29 NEED MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL 
01:53:33 GOVERNMENT IF YOU'RE IN THE COUNTY 
01:53:34 WE'LL GET THAT MONEY IF WE DON'T 
01:53:40 GET IT THE CITY HAS THE BURDEN OF 
01:53:41 FINDING MORE MONEY. YOU'LL WIN ON 
01:53:46 YOU'RE GOING TO WIN ON. STAY PASSIONATE 
01:53:47 AND GET INVOLVED

01:54:05 MANY OF US HAVE DEBATED RATHER 
01:54:14 THAN CHICAGO HAS A PUBLIC SAFETY 
01:54:15 PROBLEM. AS MY COLLEAGUE STATED THE 
01:54:19 WEST SIDE OF CHICAGO IN THE 11TH 
01:54:20 DISTRICT WHERE I LIVE HAS A PUBLIC 
01:54:23 SAFETY PROBLEM. WHEN PEOPLE SAY THIS I 
01:54:24 LIVE IN 4000 WEST MASON IF YOU 
01:54:35 KNOW NOT A HOUSE WITHIN 2 BLOCKS. 
01:54:36 HERE'S A CHALLENGE THAT FOLKS THAT 
01:54:41 DON'T LIVE ON THE WEST SIDE GOING TO 
01:54:42 COME AND TELL US HOW TO LIVE 
01:54:47 THAT'S NOT RIGHT. PEOPLE THAT LIVE ON 
01:54:48 THE NORTH SIDE FOLKS IN OTHER 
01:54:52 COMMUNITY WANT TO COME TO WEST SIDE 
01:54:53 GARFIELD AND PARK AND TELL US HOW 
01:54:57 TO LIVE THAT IS WRONG 
01:54:59 (GAVEL) 
01:55:02 >> THE INDIVIDUALS HAVE ISSUES THEY 
01:55:03 HAVE CHALLENGES AND AS 
01:55:06 WAS STATED THE ELECTED HAVE 
01:55:07 CONSEQUENCES AND YOU LOST. ELECTED HAVE 
01:55:15 CONSEQUENCES EVERYONE THAT TALKS ON 
01:55:16 WEST SIDE BUT THE PEOPLE SUPPORTED 
01:55:20 HER THE PEOPLE THAT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT 
01:55:21 HER. THE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO 
01:55:26 SUPPORT ALDERMAN BURNETTE OUR STATE 
01:55:27 REPRESENTATIVE ALL THE ELECTED 
01:55:29 OFFICIALS ON THE WEST SIDE SO AGAIN AT 
01:55:30 THE END OF THE DAY, OUR 
01:55:33 COMMUNITY DOES HAVE SOME CHALLENGES. 
01:55:34 THE ISSUES RAISED ARE NOT FALLON 
01:55:43 DEAF EARS WE NEED MORE ECONOMIC 
01:55:44 DEVELOPMENT BUT THE CITY AS A WHOLE 
01:55:47 NEEDS TO SUPPORT ON THE ANTIQUATED 
01:55:48 FACILITY O E MC BUT AGAIN, IT IS 
01:55:56 INTERESTING THE FOLKS THAT DON'T LIVE 
01:55:57 HERE THAT DON'T LIVE - ON THE 
01:56:02 WEST SIDE OF CHICAGO DON'T LIVE IN THE 
01:56:03 11TH DISTRICT ON THE WEST SIDE 
01:56:07 OF CHICAGO LIVE IN THE SUBURBS THEY 
01:56:08 WANT TO TELL YOU HOW TO LIVE I'LL 
01:56:15 NOTE STAND BY AND ALLOW THAT NARRATIVE 
01:56:16 TO TAKE PLACE. SO ALDERMAN 
01:56:21 MITTS I'LL SUPPORT YOU IN THIS ENDEAVOR 
01:56:22 ACROSS THE CREEK FROM THE WARD 
01:56:30 AND WE'LL SUPPORT ANYTHING A THERE'S 
01:56:31 THE VISIBILITY OF OUR POLICE AND 
01:56:38 FIRE IN THE COMMUNITY AND ALSO INCREASE 
01:56:39 THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ECONOMIC 
01:56:43 DEVELOPMENT ALDERMAN BURNETTE TALKED 
01:56:44 ABOUT THAT AND AGAIN, UNDERSCORES 
01:56:48 VIABILITY IN THE COMMUNITY THAT 
01:56:49 ACTUALLY WHERE THE COMMUNITY IS 
01:56:55 HUMBOLDT PARK AND WEST GARFIELD THOSE 
01:56:56 CONTINGENCY ARE GREAT. THE 
01:57:01 LEGISLATURE WEST SIDE RISES THE CITY 
01:57:02 CAN RISE. NOT FEAR THAT THE 
01:57:06 DEVELOPMENT DIDN'T OCCUR ALL OVER I'M 
01:57:07 GLAD TO SEE GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT 
01:57:14 DEVELOPMENT ON THE WEST SIDE OF CHICAGO 
01:57:15 AND AGAIN, THIS IS JUST THE 
01:57:18 BEGINNING THIS IS NOT THE END. SO 
01:57:19 ALDERMAN MITTS CONGRATULATIONS I 
01:57:23 SUPPORT THIS AND ASK THE COLLEAGUES THE 
01:57:24 SAME. 
01:57:27 >> ALDERMAN KING. 
01:57:31 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. I WON'T 
01:57:32 REPEAT A LOT OF THE 
01:57:35 STUFF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID BUT I'D 
01:57:36 LIKE TO SAY A FEW THINGS. FIRST 
01:57:41 OF ALL, I WANT TO APPLAUD GROUPS LIKE 
01:57:42 THE FARMERS DAUGHTERS (YELLING). 
01:57:49 >> AND OTHER BLACK LIVES MATTER GROUPS 
01:57:50 FOR NOT ONLY THEIR 
01:57:55 PASSION AND COMMITMENT TO THEIR 
01:57:56 CONVICTIONS BUT THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN 
01:57:59 THE PROCESS. WE NEED YOUR CONTINUED 
01:58:00 LINCOLN PARK AND VOICE IN THE 
01:58:04 SYSTEM. IT IS BECAUSE OF THE BLACK 
01:58:05 LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT THAT LIVES 
01:58:08 HAVE BEEN SHED ON THE VIOLENCE AGAINST 
01:58:09 THE BROWN AND BLACK COMMUNITY. 
01:58:13 WE NEED OUR CONTINUED VOICE I PLEDGE TO 
01:58:14 WORK WITH YOUR VOICE AND 
01:58:19 INVOLVEMENT - INVOLVEMENT. IT IS NOT 
01:58:20 LOST I UNDERSTAND IN THE MIDST 
01:58:27 HOW THIS POLICE POLICING AND FIRE 
01:58:28 ACADEMY LOOKS LIKE A REWARD. BUT 
01:58:32 THE REALITY 95 MILLIONS IS IN THE CITY 
01:58:33 BUDGET WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT A 
01:58:39 $95 MILLION INVESTMENT MILLIONS OF ARE 
01:58:40 MOVED ELSEWHERE THROUGHOUT THE 
01:58:46 CITY DOESN'T TAKE OUR EYES OFF THE 
01:58:47 BALL. I SEE THE DISPROPORTIONATE 
01:58:57 ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES THAT PLAGUE 
01:58:58 MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES IN A CITY 
01:59:01 THAT CELEBRATES A DIVERSITY OF '90 
01:59:02 PERCENT BROWN AND BLACK PEOPLE. WE 
01:59:07 CAN'T CONTINUE TO HAVE A DISPARTIED HOW 
01:59:08 THE RESOURCES ARE SPENT THAT 
01:59:12 IS HELPING TO CREATE ALTERNATIVES IF WE 
01:59:13 DON'T DO IF WE MUST GIVE THE 
01:59:20 COMMUNITY A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT 
01:59:21 IS 40 PERCENT OF BROWN AND 
01:59:27 BLACK PAY PROPERTY TAXES THEY NEED 
01:59:28 MONEY COMING TO THE COMMUNITY. 
01:59:32 THAT IS NOT HAPPENING. BROWN AND BLACK 
01:59:33 PEOPLE NEED TO BE INCLUDED AND 
01:59:37 THAT CHANGE NEEDS TO COME SOONER THAN 
01:59:38 LATER. THE POLICE AND FIRE 
01:59:43 ACADEMY, HOWEVER, NEEDS TO BE BUILT AND 
01:59:44 NEEDS TO BE BUILT IN INC., 
01:59:47 WOULD DO IT IS EXACTLY THE BEGINNING OF 
01:59:48 INVESTMENT. I MEAN THAT 
01:59:52 SHOULDN'T BE THE END OF INVESTMENT THEY 
01:59:53 SHOULD HAVE ALL THE AMENITIES 
01:59:57 IT DRIVE THE COMMUNITIES MENTAL HEALTH 
01:59:58 AND SCHOOLS WE SHOULD HAVE IT 
02:00:05 ALL IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE ALSO NEED TO 
02:00:06 MAKE SURE THAT WAS HAPPENING 
02:00:09 THAT BLACK OFFICERS ARE NOT - WE CAN'T 
02:00:10 LOOK 5 YEARS FROM NOW AND HAVE 
02:00:18 BROWN AND BLACK PEOPLE IN THE POLICE WE 
02:00:19 NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IS 
02:00:21 DOESN'T NEED TO HISPANIC. THOSE VOICES 
02:00:22 ARE LOST. BLACK RECRUITS ARE 
02:00:27 DO YOU THINK THAT'S A FACT CAN'T BE IN 
02:00:28 THE SAME SYSTEM. I AM BEGGING 
02:00:35 YOU NOT AND/OR THAT IS ABOUT INVESTMENT 
02:00:36 IN THE COMMUNITY AND MUST BE 
02:00:40 THE BEGINNING WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT 
02:00:41 LINCOLN YARD AND INGLEWOOD. 
02:00:47 >> ALDERMAN SCOTT.

02:17:41 NO COP ACADEMY. 
02:17:44 >> EMMA I FEEL IN GOOD COMPANY AT THIS 
02:17:45 POINT THE CONGRESS 
02:18:22 THEATRE UPTOWN THEATRE WAS EMPTY FOR 37 
02:18:23 YEARS THIS IS EMPTY OVER TWO 
02:18:31 OR 3 DECADES AND ALL THE INVESTMENTS 
02:18:32 REPRESENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
02:18:35 AND NOT JUST THE POLICE AND FIRE 
02:18:36 ACADEMY WE'RE ABOUT TO VOTE FOR THE 
02:18:40 FIRST TIME IN LITERALLY A DECADE OR 
02:18:41 20/20 NEW RATIONS ON THE WETLANDS 
02:18:47 AFRICAN-AMERICAN RELUCTANCE. NOW WE ARE 
02:18:48 IN - INVOLVED IN A CONSENSUS 
02:18:56 A DECREE NOTES WE HAVE TO BUILD A 
02:18:57 MODERN FACILITY FOR THE POLICE WE 
02:19:05 INCLUDED. 
02:19:06 OUR FIREFIGHTERS WE ARE TRAINING AND 
02:19:07 LEARNING TOGETHER. IN ADDITION 
02:19:10 TO THAT THIS IS THIS INVESTMENT NOT 
02:19:11 ONLY GUARANTEES WORLD-CLASS 
02:19:17 TRAINING IN THE TIME OF THIS REPORT ONE 
02:19:18 OF THE POLICE BUILDINGS WAS 
02:19:21 BURNED DOWN IN 2012, WE TALKED ABOUT 
02:19:22 MODERNIZING AND BUILDING A 
02:19:26 FACILITY FOR ALL THE ACADEMY. FOR ANY 
02:19:27 REPORT THAT WAS DONE I BELIEVE 
02:19:31 THAT NOT ONLY WILL THIS MEET THE NEEDS 
02:19:32 BUT MEET THE NEEDS OF ECONOMIC 
02:19:38 DEVELOPMENT FOR DECADES THE WEST SIDE 
02:19:39 HAS BEEN IGNORED. WHICH IS WHY 
02:19:44 ALONG WITH THAT FACILITY AND EMMA KNOWS 
02:19:45 IN HER COMMUNITY AND PARK WITH 
02:19:53 A NEW FACILITY AND TRACK, NEW FOOTBALL 
02:19:54 FIELD AND LIGHTS. IN THAT AREA 
02:19:58 NOT FOR A REGIONAL LIBRARY FOR THE 
02:19:59 FIRST TIME IN 40 SOME ODD YEARS AND 
02:20:07 CREATED A KITCHEN THAT IS $35 MILLION 
02:20:08 INVESTMENT REMODEL WITH THE NEW 
02:20:13 PEEL STATION. THOSE ARE FROM AN 
02:20:14 ECONOMIC STAND POINT IT IS TRUE ALL 
02:20:18 OF THIS YOU'RE DOING IS NOT ENOUGH 
02:20:19 COMBINED WITH THE LIQUOR AND ANY 
02:20:25 SCHOOLS AND MASS TRANSIT THE TYPE OF 
02:20:26 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT YOU WANT TO 
02:20:33 SEE ENTREPRENEURS ON THE WEST SIDE AND 
02:20:34 SOUTH SIDE. IT IS A DYNAMIC 
02:20:38 ECONOMIC THAT IS THE TYPE OF INVESTMENT 
02:20:39 WE WANT THAT MORE IMPORTANTLY 
02:20:43 TO BRING THE PUBLIC SAFETY IN PART OF 
02:20:44 THE COMMUNITY THAT HAS A 
02:20:48 CHALLENGE. AND WHEN YOU HAVE 6 HUNDRED 
02:20:49 OFFICERS COUNTLESS 
02:20:52 FIREFIGHTERS AND EMT ALL THRIVING AND 
02:20:53 TRAINING YOU SEEN THE GANGS 
02:20:59 THERE AND PEOPLE NEAR WEST SIDE WE HAVE 
02:21:00 THE ACADEMY IT WAS NOT THERE O 
02:21:10 E MC ONE OF THE WARDS. THIS IS EXACTLY 
02:21:11 WHAT THE WEST SIDE NEEDS. 
02:21:18 THIS LITERALLY JUMP STARTS NOT BY 
02:21:19 ITSELF BUT A SERIES OF INVESTMENT 
02:21:24 PARKS AND MASS TRANSIT. I DON'T THINK 
02:21:25 IT SHOULD BE LOST IN THE 
02:21:35 COVERTS I THINK ON THE SOUTH SIDE IT IS 
02:21:36 TIME TO GET THE FACILITIES 
02:21:43 WE'LL INSTITUTE ALL THE TRAINING AND 
02:21:44 THIS HAS BEEN A LONG JOURNEY A 
02:21:49 LOT OF MEETINGS AND VOICES HEARD. THE 
02:21:50 FACT WE HAD THAT REPRESENTS THE 
02:21:54 FOURTH OR 5 VOTE ON THIS SUBJECT. I 
02:21:55 APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S EFFORT AND 
02:22:02 ASK YOU TO HAVE THE SPIRIT AROUND THIS 
02:22:03 THIS IS THE TIME WHEN SOMETHING 
02:22:08 DIFFERENT WILL HAPPEN IN THE GARY FOLD 
02:22:09 HUMBLE PARK IN THE AREAS. AND 
02:22:16 ALL AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE US IN A

02:36:30 PRESIDENT AND THANK YOU, SUCH 
02:36:33 ALDERMAN FROM THE SECOND WARD. 
02:36:36 >> ALDERMAN. 
02:36:40 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
02:36:41 >> NO DOUBT THIS PROJECT WILL BRING 
02:36:42 LOTS OF JOBS 
02:36:45 CONSTRUCTION JOBS AND LOTS OF JOBS FOR 
02:36:46 ORGANIZED LABOR BUT THE RETAIL 
02:36:53 JOBS UP AND DOWN THE CITY I HEAR THAT. 
02:36:54 BUT I'M GOING TO KEEP GOING 
02:36:59 BACK TO THE ORIGINAL POINT. I'VE BEEN 
02:37:00 MAKING FOR THE LAST YEAR'S. 
02:37:07 ANY TIME I RECOGNIZE WELL MY TIME ON 
02:37:08 THIS BODY IS QUICKLY SUN SETTING 
02:37:15 YOU, YOU LEAVING THE COUNCIL I URGE YOU 
02:37:16 YOU TO THINK IT TO ADVOCATE 
02:37:22 FOR POLICY CHANGE. WHEN THERE IS A 
02:37:23 ZONING CHANGE THAT TRIGGERS THE 
02:37:28 FORCIBLE REQUIREMENTS. USUALLY 10 
02:37:29 PERCENT OF THOSE UNITS HAVE TO BE 
02:37:34 SET ASIDE AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND 
02:37:35 THE DEVELOPER HAS TWO CHOICES: 
02:37:40 TO BUILD ON SITE OR TO PAY OUT. ALSO IN 
02:37:41 THE ORDINANCE WHEN THERE'S A 
02:37:50 PUBLIC SUBSIDY INVOLVED THAT 
02:37:51 REQUIREMENT GOES UP 20 PERCENT. BUT 
02:37:57 HERE'S THE LOOPHOLE: THE DEVELOPER 
02:37:58 ALSO, IF IN SITUATION HAS TO PAY 
02:38:05 OUT OR BUILD ONSITE. THE PROBLEM IS IF 
02:38:06 WE PROVIDE THE DEVELOPER WITH 
02:38:12 A PUBLIC SUBSIDY AND ALLOW THEM TO PAY 
02:38:13 OUT, IT LIKE WE'RE PASSERBY 
02:38:20 OURSELVES BACK WITH OUR OWN MONEY. WHAT 
02:38:21 IS THE POINT OF UPPING THE 
02:38:27 REQUIREMENT FOR THAT PUBLIC SUBSIDY IF 
02:38:28 WE ALLOW THE DEVELOPERS TO PAY 
02:38:32 OUT FOR BUILDING THOSE HOUSING ONSITE? 
02:38:35 >> NOW THERE IS LEGISLATION THAT 
02:38:36 SITTING IN COMMITTEE FOR 
02:38:40 ALMOST 2 YEARS WAS TRANSFERRED BY 
02:38:41 ALDERMAN MORENO. WE CAN STILL MOVE 
02:38:48 THAT NEXT MONTH THE NEW COUNSELORS CAN 
02:38:49 TAKE THAT UP THIS IS A LOOPHOLE 
02:38:55 THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. WE GET 600 
02:38:56 UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
02:39:00 ONSITE AS AMPLIFIES HAS NEGOTIATED THE 
02:39:01 REQUIREMENT IS 1200 UNITS. AND 
02:39:10 SO ANOTHER 600 UNITS WHAT WE PAID OUT. 
02:39:11 NOW HERE'S THE OTHER PART. 
02:39:18 PART OF PROMISE OF SOME OF THE OPTED BE 
02:39:19 ARE BUILT WITHIN A RANGE. BUT 
02:39:25 THE CORRESPONDING ZONING WE CONGRESSMAN 
02:39:26 HAS BEEN APPLIED. A CHANCE 
02:39:31 THAT IN ORDER TO BUILD THOSE AFFORDABLE 
02:39:32 UNITS HAVE TO GO TO THE LOCAL 
02:39:38 ALDERMAN AND GET THE ZONING CHANGES TO 
02:39:39 MOVE THOSE PROJECTS WE KNOW 
02:39:44 WHAT HAPPENS. NOT ONLY IN THE CITY BUT 
02:39:45 EVERY MAJOR CITY AROUND THE 
02:39:51 WORLD WHAT THAT COMES TO AFFORDABLE 
02:39:52 HOUSING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THAT 
02:39:56 BILL. THE UGLY NARRATIVE THAT ALL COMES 
02:39:57 OUT. THIS WILL BE A 
02:40:03 DIFFERENT CONVERSATION IF WE'RE 
02:40:04 REQUIRING THE UNIT BUILT UNIT ALL OF 
02:40:09 THEM OR IF WE HAVE THE BUILDING IN THE 
02:40:10 RADIUS WOULD BE ASSIGNED WITH 
02:40:17 THIS DEAL. THE OTHER CONVERSATION IF WE 
02:40:18 ARE WILLING TO ALLOW UNIT 
02:40:24 THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BUILT ONSITE 
02:40:25 AND NOW GO SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT 
02:40:31 IS REASONABLE FOR SOMEONE TO SAY WELL, 
02:40:32 THAT COMMUNITY DIDN'T WANT THAT 
02:40:36 AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT AND WHY DO YOU 
02:40:37 WANT TO PUT THEM IN MINE? 
02:40:40 >> WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY 
02:40:41 HERE AND TO BUILD A 
02:40:47 MASSIVE 60 SOMETHING FOR THE RECORD NOT 
02:40:48 A BAD THING TO SUBMIT THE 
02:40:55 LARGE-SCALE MIXED DEVELOPMENT THEY CAN 
02:40:56 BE BUILT ANYWHERE. AGAIN WORK 
02:41:03 WITH THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY TO 
02:41:04 MAKE THAT 25 PERCENT FORCIBLE 
02:41:09 AND PROCESS THIS BECAUSE THE 
02:41:10 OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR A 
02:41:15 150 PERCENT OF OUR HOUSING IF WE CHOOSE 
02:41:16 TO DO THAT. THIS GETTING INTO 
02:41:23 THE WEEDS BUT PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT 
02:41:24 I SEE BUILDING AFFORDABLE 
02:41:27 HOUSING WHETHER IN SUPPORTING 7 ARE 
02:41:28 SECOND QUARTER OR ANYWHERE THAT 
02:41:32 THE REQUIREMENT DO BUILD MORE 
02:41:33 AFFORDABLE HOUSING ONSITE THE BANKS SAY 
02:41:37 WE DON'T WANT THIS TOO MUCH RISK SO I 
02:41:38 APPLAUD MR. PRESIDENT WE 
02:41:44 ESTABLISH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING WE 
02:41:45 STILL GOING FORWARD THE CITY 
02:41:51 CAN'T RELY ON THE MARKETPLACE AN 
02:41:52 INCENTIVE FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
02:41:59 ON SITE. ONLY WAY TO GET MORE 
02:42:00 AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH A LARGE-SCALE 
02:42:06 DEVELOPMENT FOR THE CITY TO TAKE A ROLE 
02:42:07 WHETHER OR NOT EQUITY PARTNERS 
02:42:10 OR BOTH. THE CITY SHOULD BE A 
02:42:11 DEVELOPER. TEND TO GET MORE MIXING 
02:42:18 THEN WE NEED TO CLOSE THIS LOOPHOLE. WE 
02:42:19 CAN'T KEEP INCENTIVEIZING THE 
02:42:26 DEVELOPMENT AND ALLOW THE DEVELOPERS TO 
02:42:27 PAY OUT. WE HAVE TO DO RIGHT 
02:42:32 ON ALL SIDES OF THE EQUATION. 
02:42:42 >> I WANT TO CLOSE PEOPLE ALSO TALKING 
02:42:43 ABOUT 
02:42:48 [OFF MIC.] THE CITY OF CHICAGO HAD GROW 
02:42:49 IT WILL GROW BECAUSE WE HAVE 
02:42:55 ACCESS TO WATER. A LOT OF THE 
02:42:56 DEVELOPMENT OVER THE NEXT 10 OR 
02:43:00 15 YEARS GLOBAL INVESTORS WILL BUY 
02:43:01 HERE. CONDOMINIUM CONVERSION IS 
02:43:08 REAL AND WHILE SOME OF THOSE SOUNDS 
02:43:09 LIKE THEY'RE TWO BIG JUST KNOW THE 
02:43:14 MONEY IS FLOWING THE MONEY THAT E IS 
02:43:15 FLOWING BECAUSE OF FACT. SO WE 
02:43:20 HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS FROM A BIGGER 
02:43:21 PERSPECTIVE AND LIKE CHANGES IN 
02:43:28 POPULATION WE'RE GROWING IT WILL - 
02:43:29 WE'LL CONTINUE TO GROW. AND TIME 
02:43:34 TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES I ASK YOU DO 
02:43:35 THIS AT THE NEXT CITY COUNCIL 
02:43:42 MEETING WE PROVIDE SUBSIDIES TO MAJOR 
02:43:43 DEVELOPERS AND A LOT OF US PAY 
02:43:47 OUT WITH OUR OWN MONEY. THANK YOU. 
02:43:53 >> 
02:43:54 (GAVEL) 
02:44:02 >> I WAS UNDECIDED ABOUT THIS STUDIED 
02:44:03 QUITE A WHILE AND SO 
02:44:07 WHAT I WANT TO LOOK AT HOW THIS TAX 
02:44:08 INCENTIVE IMPACTS ME. RIGHT NOW 
02:44:16 THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS AN UNEMPLOYMENT 
02:44:17 RATE WITH THE AGES OF 18 TO 24 
02:44:23 OF NEARLY 80 PERCENT OF BLACK MEN NOT 
02:44:24 WORKING. THIS DEVELOPMENT ENDED 
02:44:31 UP MY COLLEAGUE SAID THE MONEY IS 
02:44:32 FLOWING AND IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO 
02:44:39 NOT GOING EVERYWHERE IN THE CITY OF AND 
02:44:40 NOT ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF 
02:44:48 CHICAGO HOW DO WE TAKE THIS DEVELOPMENT 
02:44:49 AND STRETCH IT OUT TO THE FAR 
02:44:56 REACHES. HOW DOES THE DEVELOPER - 
02:44:57 DEVELOPMENT IMPACT THE WEST SIDE IF 
02:45:04 25 TO THIRTY THOUSAND JOBS DON'T 
02:45:05 STRETCH TO THE WEST SIDE SOUTH SIDE 
02:45:09 OR THE WEST SIDE THEN THIS PROJECT IS 
02:45:10 BAD FOR THE CITY. SO IT IS MY 
02:45:16 URGING THE CITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 
02:45:17 HAVE SUBCONTRACTORS THAT ARE 
02:45:21 MINORITY THAT ARE UNDER THE CONTRACT. 
02:45:22 ON THIS PROJECT. THE BLACK AND 
02:45:31 LATINOS HAVE AN - ALDERMAN I WANT TO 
02:45:32 SAY I COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR 
02:45:39 EFFORTS THE CONCESSIONS THAT YOU HAVE 
02:45:40 MADE CONCESSIONS YOUR COMMUNITY 
02:45:45 HAS MADE TO MAKE SURE THAT PROJECT IS 
02:45:46 VISIBLE FOR THE COMMUNITY. I 
02:45:50 THANK YOU, FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND I 
02:45:51 SUPPORT YOU TODAY. AND I URGE 
02:45:54 YOU YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT IS CONTINUED 
02:45:55 IN THE R IT REACHES EVERY 
02:46:00 NEIGHBORHOOD. THANK YOU. 
02:46:08 >> ALDERMAN. 
02:46:09 >> I STAND I'M NOT GOING TO SNORT HAS 
02:46:10 TO DO WITH WITH 
02:46:15 ANYTHING AGAINST ALDERMAN OR TRYING TO 
02:46:16 GO AGAINST ALDERMAN HOPKINS. 
02:46:21 >> I DON'T WANT TO STAND HERE AND FIGHT 
02:46:22 OR ARGUE WITH ONE 
02:46:26 OF MY COLLEAGUES TO BE ABLE TO GET IN 
02:46:27 MONEY OR BRING IN THE MONEY 
02:46:32 $6.5 BILLION IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
02:46:33 GOING TO YOUR WARD. I SAT WITH 
02:46:39 BILL 5 NEW BRIDGES 3 NEW BRIDGES I HAVE 
02:46:40 5 IN MY WARD THAT ARE FAILING 
02:46:46 INTO THE RIVER THEY'LL GIVE US $19 
02:46:47 MILLION THAT IS PUTTING A BAND AID 
02:46:53 I HAVE THE GO BIGGEST WARD IN THE CITY 
02:46:54 THE BIGGEST ONE $.3 MILLION 
02:46:59 GETS US 8/CITY BLOCKS. I HAVE OVER 400 
02:47:00 MILES OF ROAD I HAVE ZERO 
02:47:12 MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES I HAVE SCHOOLS 
02:47:15 LITERALLY CRUMBLING THEY WERE BUILT FOR 
02:47:16 10 YEARS BECAUSE IT WAS A 
02:47:22 TEMPORARY STRUCTURE THE WALLS ARE 
02:47:23 PULLING AWAY FROM THE FLOOR WE'RE 
02:47:28 SANDBAGGING WHEN IT RAINS I HAVE THE 
02:47:29 HUNDRED KIDS IF THERE. 43 YEARS 
02:47:36 BEEN THERE. I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS 
02:47:37 BECAUSE I NEED A COMMITMENT TO SOME 
02:47:42 OF THAT $605 BILLION IN ECONOMIC 
02:47:43 DEVELOPMENT IS GOING TO COME DO MY 
02:47:48 DO. NOT AGAINST ME OR I WILL SUPPORT 
02:47:49 YOU BUT BY NEED A COMMITMENT 
02:47:53 THAT SOME OF THAT MONEY WILL COME BACK 
02:47:54 TO THE SOUTH SIDE. AND THAT'S 
02:47:58 WHY I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS I 
02:47:59 LOBBIED HARD. THAT SUPPORTS 
02:48:03 UNIONS AND LABOR MORE THAN NOBODY. I 
02:48:04 SUPPORT FAIR WAGES AND LIVING 
02:48:09 WAGES AND JOBS BECAUSE MY HUSBAND AND 
02:48:10 KIDS BUT I NEED SOME OF THAT 
02:48:15 MONEY TO COME BACK BECAUSE WE'RE DYING 
02:48:16 HERE. THANK YOU. 
02:48:24 >> I WOULD LIKE SOME OF 3 MONEY TO COME 
02:48:25 BACK HERE. 
02:48:28 >> ALDERMAN SMITH I WANT TO SHOW 
02:48:29 SOLIDARITY TO THE WARD. 
02:48:41 WE'RE NOT AS FORTUNATE IN ECONOMIC 
02:48:42 DEVELOPMENT 
02:48:46 ALL THE PUBLIC BENEFITS, YOU KNOW, 
02:48:47 DEPENDS ON A BILLION DOLLARS 
02:48:55 SUBSIDY. MONEY THAT CAN GO TO HELP 
02:48:56 ALDERMAN'S AND TO HELP MANY OF 
02:49:04 YOU. AND WE DO HAVE CAPITAL IN OUR WARD 
02:49:05 WE DON'T HAVE PITS WE HAVEN'T 
02:49:15 HAD AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY 
02:49:16 BUT WHEN WE REDEVELOPED THE 
02:49:20 HOSPITAL WE REQUIRED THEM FROM THE 
02:49:21 OUTSIDE NOT AT THE LAST MINUTE TO 
02:49:26 BUILD ONSITE OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET 
02:49:27 WITHOUT A 10 PERCENT AFFORDABLE 
02:49:32 HOUSING. WHICH WILL BE OPENING THIS 
02:49:33 YEAR. SO DON'T TELL ME THAT 
02:49:37 CAN'T BE DONE IF ONE OF THE WEALTHIST 
02:49:38 COMMUNITIES IN THE UNITED 
02:49:43 STATES. THAT 10 PERCENT AFFORDABLE 
02:49:44 HOUSING CAN'T BE BUILT ONSITE BY 
02:49:48 AND DEVELOPER WITHOUT A HANDOUT BECAUSE 
02:49:49 WE JUST DID IT. SO - I WILL 
02:49:59 SAY WE WELCOME DEVELOPMENT. I LIKE SIDE 
02:50:00 ALDERMAN SUPPORT THIS TRADE. 
02:50:05 WE WANT IT. BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE 
02:50:06 THROUGH A HANDOUT. WHICH WE 
02:50:12 WILL BE ABLE TO CONSIDER. THIS 
02:50:13 DEVELOPMENT GIVEN IT'S SHEER SIZE IS 
02:50:20 OF THE SAME IMPORTANCE AS CITYWIDE 
02:50:21 DEVELOPMENT THAT COMES BEFORE THIS 
02:50:28 COUNCIL STARTING WITH THE CHILDREN'S 
02:50:29 MUSEUMS AND THE LOUIS TO THE 
02:50:35 PRESIDENT OBAMA CENTER GENERATED 
02:50:36 CONTROVERSY SO I THINK THAT IS NO 
02:50:42 PREROGATIVE WHICH SOMETHING THAT IS $6 
02:50:43 BILLION ALMOST THE SIZE OF YOUR 
02:50:49 CAPITAL CITY'S BUDGET TO BE CONSIDERED. 
02:50:50 BUT EVEN BEYOND THAT THE 
02:50:56 FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IS THE PROCESS. OTHER 
02:50:57 DEVELOPMENTS LIKE THE ONE I 
02:51:05 DESCRIBED GIVEN TIME FOR - COULD HAVE 
02:51:06 AN MAJOR IMPACT CONSIDERED OVER 
02:51:13 8 YEARS. FIRST TIME WE SAW A PLAN NOT A 
02:51:14 FRAMEWORK WAS 7 MONTHS AGO 
02:51:19 THAT ALONE SHOULD GIVE US PAUSE. SO 
02:51:20 WITH THAT, I SIMPLY REPEAT THIS 
02:51:29 DEVELOPMENT SHOULDN'T GO FORWARD NOW 
02:51:30 SHOULD BE GIVEN MORE 
02:51:32 CONSIDERATION AND I'LL BE VOTING NO. 
02:51:36 >> ALDERMAN AND I RISE - WITH THE UP 
02:51:37 ZONING YOU'RE GETTING 
02:51:49 SOMEONE ELSE; RIGHT? A BIG DIFFERENCE 
02:51:50 WHETHER OR NOT A DEVELOPER CAN 
02:51:54 BUILD AND 6 FAMILY HOME ON A LOT OR 20. 
02:51:55 THAT UP ZONE IF WESTERN TO 
02:52:02 GRANT IT TODAY WILL GIVE THE DEVELOPER 
02:52:03 BEHIND THIS 30 DAYS AN ENORMOUS 
02:52:08 ENORMOUS BENEFIT. THAT WILL HELP TO 
02:52:09 MAKE THEM PROSPER. SO THE REASON 
02:52:15 I'M NO OPPOSITION TO THIS BECAUSE WE'RE 
02:52:16 TOLD WE SHOULD GIVE THIS UP 
02:52:20 ZONE BUILD THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THE LURK 
02:52:21 THEY NEED BUT IN ORDER TO DO 
02:52:27 THIS THEY ALSO ONE .3 MILLION SUPPOSED 
02:52:28 - IN EFFECT WHAT IS ASKING US 
02:52:41 TO DO IS TO BECOME A PARTICIPANT IN THE 
02:52:42 VENTURE. SO THE QUESTION I 
02:52:47 ASK OF THE ZONING INDUSTRY WAS CAN 
02:52:48 SOMEONE SHOW ME A SPREADSHEET THE 
02:52:57 VALUE THEY NEED TO X TRACK AND WHAT 
02:52:58 HAPPENS IF THEY DON'T. NO ONE CAN 
02:53:03 SHOW ME THAT WE'RE ABOUT ALLOWING THIS 
02:53:04 PROJECT DEBATING HAVING THE 
02:53:10 CITY A PARTNER IN THE MEASURE OF THIS 
02:53:11 PROGRESS BUT WE AS A COUNCIL 
02:53:17 PEOPLE ARE INVITED TO BE PART OF THAT 
02:53:18 VENTURE TO KNOW WHAT THE 
02:53:21 FINANCING OF THIS PROJECT IS. THAT'S A 
02:53:22 QUESTION I HAVE. DOES THAT UP 
02:53:27 ZONE DIRECT NOT ALLOW YOU TO MAKE A 
02:53:28 NONPROFIT OR PROFIT AT ALL? 
02:53:33 >> I'M PRETTY MUCH THAT STEERING WHEEL 
02:53:34 EVEN IF THEY HAD TO 
02:53:40 EVEN IF THEY HAVE TO PAY TO RESERVE 
02:53:41 WILL MAKE A VERY SIZEABLE AND NICE 
02:53:48 PROFIT. AND WOULD NOT NEED TO FINANCE 
02:53:49 TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. THAT'S 
02:53:53 WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON TODAY, WE'RE 
02:53:54 VOTING WHAT IS NECESSARY TO YOU 
02:53:58 BUILD THAT DEVELOPMENT AND MAKE THEM A 
02:53:59 LOT OF MONEY. I WENT BACK TO 
02:54:04 AND LOOKED STYLISTS THERE IS A 
02:54:05 BEAUTIFUL LITTLE NEIGHBORHOOD NOT IN MY 
02:54:12 WARD. IT WAS DEVELOPED THEY HAD SMALL 
02:54:13 WHOLESALER AND ANOTHER 
02:54:20 DEVELOPER SAID HEY YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT 
02:54:21 TO EXTRACT MORE PROFIT BUILD 
02:54:28 MORE HOMES FOR THE FOLKS 
02:54:30 UP AND COMING 50 MINUTES IN DOWNTOWN 
02:54:31 CHICAGO YOU KNOW WHAT TO MAKE 
02:54:39 THAT VILLA POSSIBLE THEY PAID FOR NEW 
02:54:40 ROADS 80 THEY PUT IN NEW 
02:54:48 INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUSHES AND SHRUBS 
02:54:49 WHY ARE WE NOT ASKING FOR THINGS 
02:54:55 IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO WHY HAVE THEY IT 
02:54:56 NOT GIVEN US A SPREADSHEET IT 
02:55:01 IS NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE THAT VENTURE 
02:55:02 PROPERTYABLY WHEN YOU VOTE FOR THIS 
02:55:06 TODAY YOUR OPENING UP THIS SOAR THAT'S 
02:55:07 WHY I'M IN OPPOSITION NOT 
02:55:14 BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BUILD IN DEVELOPMENT 
02:55:15 THIS IS A DIFFERENT 
02:55:17 CONVERSATION. BUT BECAUSE I'M NOT 
02:55:18 SAYING THEY SHOULDN'T THEMSELVES IN 
02:55:24 EXCHANGE FOR THIS UP ZONING BE PAYING 
02:55:25 FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE THEY 
02:55:28 THEMSELVES NEED TO EXTRACT PROFIT. 
02:55:29 THANK YOU. 
02:55:35 >> 
02:55:36 (GAVEL) 
02:55:38 >> ALDERMAN BURNETTE. 
02:55:39 >> MR. PRESIDENT, SO I HAD THE 
02:55:40 OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS 3 
02:55:52 LEVELS ONE AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION 
02:55:53 AND ONE AT DONNING AND NOW HERE. 
02:56:01 SO STEERING WHEEL BAY DOES A LOT OF 
02:56:02 WORK IN MY WARD. A PROPERTY AND 
02:56:12 BUILT A LIBRARY IN MY WARD STEERING 
02:56:13 WHEEL BAY IS FRONT AND CENTER. SO 
02:56:25 THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE NO MONEY IN IT; 
02:56:26 RIGHT? SO THEY FRONT THE MONEY 
02:56:31 TO DO THEIR CONSTRUCTION. SO THIS IS 
02:56:32 THE OLD SITE AS A MATTER OF FACT 
02:56:39 I THINK WITH THE INDUSTRIAL 
02:56:40 ORGANIZATION YEARS AGO HAD OCCUPANTS 
02:56:41 THERE 
02:56:45 AND IT IS A PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT IS 
02:56:46 CONTAMINATED; RIGHT? WITH A 
02:56:49 WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS THAT CALLS OR 
02:56:50 COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO CLEAN UP. 
02:56:57 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BRIDGES, WE'RE 
02:56:58 TALKING ABOUT A RIVER WALK, WE'RE 
02:57:02 TALKING ABOUT SHORING A WALL, TUBBING 
02:57:03 EXTENSIVE OF THE 606 TRAILS A 
02:57:10 LOT OF THINGS THAT WILL ADD TO THE 
02:57:11 ATTRACTION OF CHICAGO. BUT WE 
02:57:17 DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR THE CITY OF 
02:57:18 CHICAGO DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO 
02:57:22 DO THAT. SO THE CITY IS TAKING THE 
02:57:23 OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE SOMEONE'S 
02:57:28 WANTING TO DO SOMETHING TO GET THE 
02:57:29 THINGS WE NEED TO HELP TO ATTRACT 
02:57:34 MORE PEOPLE TO THE CITY OF CHICAGO AND 
02:57:35 WE'RE TAKING MONEY OUT OF THIS 
02:57:46 64 MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF A DENSITY 
02:57:47 BONUS INTO A COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT 
02:57:52 THE CITY OF CHICAGO IN PARTICULAR WITH 
02:57:53 THE SOUTH SIDE AND WEST SIDE 
02:57:57 $4 MILLION 64 MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT A 
02:57:58 BIG DEAL ON THE NORTH SIDE OF 
02:58:02 $4 MILLION NOT A BIG DEAL IN THE WEST 
02:58:03 SIDE. 64 MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT 
02:58:06 A BIG DEAL DOWNTOWN. BUT 64 MILLION 
02:58:07 DOLLARS IS A BIG, BIG BIG DEAL ON 
02:58:14 THE WEST SIDE OR THE SOUTH SIDE. ALSO 
02:58:15 THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT 
02:58:21 $59 MILLION - $59 MILLION OF INDUSTRIAL 
02:58:25 CORRIDOR PAYMENT FOR CITYWIDE 
02:58:33 INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS THAT CAN GO - TO 
02:58:34 THE ALDERMAN'S WARD HAS A BAD 
02:58:42 INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITY THAT NEEDS THE 
02:58:43 MONEY THAT THE CITY DON'T HAVE IN 
02:58:46 ORDER TO SUPPLEMENT THAT $56 MILLION 
02:58:47 WE'LL SEE IN THE HELP TO SUBMIT 
02:58:55 SOME OF THE THINGS. ALL OF THE WARDS 
02:58:56 DON'T HAVE THE INDUSTRIAL AREAS 
02:58:59 LIKE HAD AND NEEDS TO THIS INVESTMENT. 
02:59:00 $56 MILLION IS A LOT OF MONEY. 
02:59:06 TO GO TO THOSE AREAS. THIS ORGANIZATION 
02:59:07 ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING 
02:59:11 WE'RE TELLING THEM OKAY. YOU HAVE TO 
02:59:12 PUT YOUR MONEY UP FRONTED AND 
02:59:18 SPEND MONEY FIRST AND HELP THE CITY 
02:59:19 FIRST. THEN WE'RE GOING TO GIVE 
02:59:23 YOU LEVERAGE TO GET THE MONEY AFTER YOU 
02:59:24 BUILD OUR PROPERTY AND THE 
02:59:30 MONEY IS NOT THROUGH IT IS JUST YOU 
02:59:31 BUILD AND PAY THE SUBSIDIES TO THE 
02:59:36 CITY THEN IF GOES TO A PROCESS NOT THE 
02:59:37 MONEY WE HAVE THAT WE GIVING TO 
02:59:44 ANYONE BUT MONEY THAT WOULDN'T BE GRADE 
02:59:45 IF WE DIDN'T HAVE SENSE TO 
02:59:49 BUILD ON THIS PROPERTY THAT IS 
02:59:50 CONTAMINATED AND SITTING THERE I 
03:00:03 COMMEND ALL THE FOLKS - ON ANOTHER NOTE 
03:00:04 THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ON 
03:00:17 MAY 1ST AFFORDABLE HOUSING THEY WANT TO 
03:00:18 DO THIS THEY CONTACT AND SAID 
03:00:21 WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE. THEN THEY SAID 
03:00:22 WE'LL DO 20 PERCENT OF THE 
03:00:27 REQUIREMENTS AND GOING TO DO 20 PERCENT 
03:00:28 INSTEAD OF PAYING INTO THE FEE 
03:00:33 WHICH IS A FEE THAT GOES INTO THE LOW 
03:00:34 INCOME HOUSING TRUST FUND THAT 
03:00:40 HELPS TO SUPPLEMENT ON THE WEST SIDE 
03:00:41 AND SOUTH SIDE THAT THE 
03:00:46 AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT NEEDS 
03:00:47 AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE DEVELOPERS CANNOT 
03:00:51 SURVIVE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY 
03:00:52 TO SUBSIDIES SO THEY'LL PUT 
03:00:58 $3 MILLION IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN TO $39 
03:00:59 MILLION IS GOOD EVENING TO THIS 
03:01:02 FUND. BUT THEN THEY GOING TO TAKE THAT 
03:01:03 HUNDRED AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND 
03:01:09 BUILD WITHIN 3 MILES WE ARE GOING TO 
03:01:10 JUST THANK GOD THIS WILL AFFECT 
03:01:19 THE FIRST WARD AND CUT THE 28 WARD AND 
03:01:20 PROBABLY WILL CUT THE 24 WARD 
03:01:26 AND MAYBE EVEN THE 37 WARD WE HAVE TO 
03:01:27 DRAW THE LINE THAT MEANS IN SOME 
03:01:32 PARTS THEY BELIEVE THIS BUT I HAVE OVER 
03:01:33 1,000 VACANT LOTS IN MY WARD 
03:01:40 BELIEVE IT OR NOT ON THE WEST SIDE MY 
03:01:41 OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE JUST AS 
03:01:45 MUCH OR MORE IN THEIR WARDS. I WENT ON 
03:01:46 A TOUR WITH THAT COMPANY TO A 
03:01:52 PLACE THEY HAVE HOUSING AND THEY SHE 
03:01:53 TIMED HOUSING TO BUILD ON THE 
03:01:57 AFFORDABLE LOTS THAT THEY CAN BUILD ON 
03:01:58 THE LOTS LET ME TELL YOU IF I 
03:02:05 CAN GET THOSE LOTS ON WAS WEST SIDE IT 
03:02:06 WILL CHANGE OVER NIGHT. YOU 
03:02:12 CAN GET THEM BUILT IN HIS WARD AND EMA 
03:02:13 AND SCOTT I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY 
03:02:21 WAS ON THE FIRST WARD BUT THINGS CHANGE 
03:02:22 BUT IT WILL MAKE A DIG 
03:02:29 DIFFERENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT IS 
03:02:30 SOMETHING THAT IS BOG FAIR 
03:02:35 WITH US FROM ANOTHER WARD. AND IT WILL 
03:02:36 HAVE AN IMPACT AND WAY MORE 
03:02:41 TAX DOLLARS FROM PROPERTY THAT IS 
03:02:42 AVAILABILITY TALKING ABOUT 
03:02:48 PROPERTIES 3 HAS BEEN VACANT ON THE 
03:02:49 WEST SIDE SITS WITH GANGS STILL. 
03:02:54 THIS WILL HELP TO BRING THE ELEMENTS IN 
03:02:55 THOSE AREAS. THIS IS A GOOD

03:07:10 COMMENDING ALL THE HARD WORK THAT HE 
03:07:11 DID MANY, MANY MEETINGS FOR A 
03:07:16 YEAR ON THIS PROJECT. BUT I LOOKED IN 
03:07:17 AND THIS IS NOT A DOWN ZONING 
03:07:25 APPROVED PLAN OR UP ZONING OF - THIS IS 
03:07:26 CREATING A NEW NEIGHBORHOOD IN 
03:07:32 THE CITY OF CHICAGO THIS IS CREATING A

03:07:45 IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO. 10 AND 
03:07:54 15 THOUSAND PEOPLE ON THIS SITE. MY 
03:07:55 MAIN ISSUE IS WHAT IS THE RUSH? 
03:08:00 >> I'VE BEEN AN ALDERMAN FOR 8 YEARS 
03:08:01 AND STATE REP FOR 
03:08:06 11 YEARS BEFORE THAT MEANTIME ANYTIME I 
03:08:07 SEE THE VOTE FOR A DEVELOPMENT 
03:08:13 OR A VOTE NEVER IN THAT TIME HAVE I 
03:08:14 EVER SEEN A DEAL THAT WAS BETTER 
03:08:20 AFTERWARD AND NEVER AS THAT VOTE WENT 
03:08:21 DOWN THAT DAY THAT DEAL DIDN'T 
03:08:26 COME BACK. I HAVE NO DOUBT IF THIS 
03:08:27 FAILS TODAY, THE PEOPLE 
03:08:31 ENCOURAGING TO VOTE THIS DOWN WE'LL 
03:08:32 WESTBOUND BACK WITH STEERING BAG 
03:08:35 WITH A BETTER DEAL. I WANT YOU TO THINK 
03:08:36 ABOUT THIS. ALDERMAN 
03:08:42 CAPPLEMAN A TEMPORARY ZONING COMMITTEE 
03:08:43 IT CHAIRMAN SAID HE WANTED MORE 
03:08:47 AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND STEERING WHEEL 
03:08:48 BAY DOUBLE DOWN THAT AND 
03:08:52 ALDERMAN SMITH SAID WE NEED MORE 
03:08:53 PARKLAND THEY DOUBLED THAT THAT ABOUT 
03:08:58 WHAT TWO MORE MONTHS FOR CONTRACTS FOR 
03:08:59 MIRANDA ON THE WEST SIDE THINK 
03:09:05 ABOUT THAT YOU DO YOU THINK THEY'LL 
03:09:06 WALK AWAY FROM THIS DEAL 
03:09:09 ABSOLUTELY NO. $900 MILLION OF THIS 
03:09:10 MONEY FOR THIS PROJECT. I'VE GOT 
03:09:17 CONCERNS ABOUT THIS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
03:09:18 WE WANT TO PUT AFFORDABLE 
03:09:22 HOUSING ON SITE WHY NOT PUT IT ONSITE 
03:09:23 WHAT'S WRONG WITH 10 OR 15 
03:09:29 THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVING I DID NOT IN 
03:09:30 THEIR ALDERMAN MUNOZ IS THIS 
03:09:35 CREATES DIVERSITY IN OUR CITY WE HAVE 
03:09:36 DIVERSITY FOR AFFORDABLE UNITS 
03:09:42 THOSE ARE FINE THAT IS REPETITIVE OF 
03:09:43 OUR CITY. BE GOODBYE GOOD FOR 
03:09:49 YOU THE PEOPLE TO LIVE THERE AND SMALL 
03:09:50 BUSINESSES WHAT IS THE EFFECT 
03:09:53 WILL HAVE ON SMALL BUSINESSES 
03:09:54 THROUGHOUT THE CITY OF CHICAGO. WE HAVE 
03:09:58 HEARD THAT WE PASSED ORDINANCE TODAY 
03:09:59 DEALING WITH THE UPTOWN THEATRES 
03:10:04 IT HAS TAKEN 30 YEARS FOR UPTOWN TO GET 
03:10:05 UPTOWN ENTERTAINMENT CENTERS 
03:10:11 ABOUT TO TAKE OFF. THIS DEVELOPMENT 
03:10:12 GOES WE'LL PUT MUSK VENTURES THIS 
03:10:18 NEIGHBORHOOD - CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOOD. 
03:10:19 YOU TALK ABOUT DISADVANTAGE I 
03:10:27 REPRESENT AN AREA LIKE THE LONG THE 
03:10:28 LAKE SHELTERING ROAD AND GET OFF 
03:10:34 ON SHELTERING ROAD YOU'LL SEE WHAT THAT 
03:10:35 HALLOWS 20 OR 30 STORY 
03:10:40 BELIEVES THOSE WILL BE 50 OR 60 AND 
03:10:41 OFFICE SPACE YOU TALK ABOUT 
03:10:47 QUALITY OF LIFE AND DENSITY THIS WILL 
03:10:48 BE SUPER SIZED. DO WE NEED 
03:10:51 THAT? THIS IS NOT LINCOLN YARD. I HAVE 
03:10:52 TO MORE PROBLEMS. FIRST IS 
03:10:59 HOW WE'RE PAYING FOR IF WE TALKED ABOUT 
03:11:00 THIS WE'RE HELPING THEM ALONG 
03:11:05 OR THEY'RE MAKING A MAJOR INVESTMENT WE 
03:11:06 ARE CREATING AND TIFF IN A 
03:11:12 BLIGHTED AREA. BLIGHTED AREAS ARE YOU 
03:11:13 KIDDING ME $900 MILLION FOR 
03:11:20 23 YEARS WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THE 
03:11:21 COMMUNITY SERVICES AND POLICE AND 
03:11:27 EVERYTHING ELSE? FOR 23 YEARS WE'RE 
03:11:28 LOCKED IN THE PROPOSAL 
03:11:31 $450 MILLION FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR 
03:11:32 ROADS AND ALL THOSE THINGS WHERE 
03:11:37 WILL THE 450 COME FROM WE DON'T KNOW IF 
03:11:38 WE BEGIN TO ACCELERATE THE 
03:11:43 MONEY IS THERE AND MORE MONEY IS COMING 
03:11:44 IN WHERE WILL HAD THAT MONEY 
03:11:49 GO? I THINK I'VE BEEN A STATE 
03:11:50 REPRESENTATIVE FOR 11 YEARS AND DEMOCRAT 
03:11:58 GOVERNOR AND DEMOCRAT MINORITY TO GET 
03:11:59 THAT SUNSHINE ON MAY 31ST I HAVE 
03:12:04 NO DOUBT IN MY MIND IF WE GET A STATE 
03:12:05 CAPITAL BILL AND THE CITY OF 
03:12:12 CHICAGO WILL GET MONEY FOR ROADS. WHY 
03:12:13 NOT WAIT FOR THE 
03:12:18 INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT IF SOME OF THE 
03:12:19 MONEY GOES TO HELP WITH THE ROADS 
03:12:23 THIS WILL TAKE EVENT YEARS TO BUILD 
03:12:24 LET'S WAIT UNTIL MAY 31ST CUTS 
03:12:32 DOWN THE COST AND PREVENTS US FROM 
03:12:33 DOING A TIFF IF STEERING BAY WANT 
03:12:39 TO SAY PAY FOR THIS LET'S WAIT, WAIT TO 
03:12:40 SEE HOW THAT GOES. THINK OF 
03:12:47 YOUR TIME ON MAY 31ST BY TWO-THIRDS 
03:12:48 MAYBE THEY PASS A BUDGET AND 
03:12:53 CAPITAL BUDGET AND GET X AMOUNT OF 
03:12:54 MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE'RE HUNG WITH 
03:13:01 $900.86 FOR 23 YEARS TO DEAL WITH THAT 
03:13:02 WILL. THE OTHER MAIN ISSUE IS 
03:13:08 THE DIRECTION OF STOCK. FOR THE 
03:13:09 COMMUNITY TO GROW STRONG AND STABLE 
03:13:14 EVERY COMMUNITY HAS TO GROW. WE HAVE TO 
03:13:15 HAVE POSITIVE STEADY 
03:13:18 COMMUNITY MINDED PEOPLE ON THE WEST 
03:13:19 SIDE. THIS IS LOCATED ON LINCOLN 
03:13:25 AND BUCK TOWN. YOU KNOW, I GO BACK TO 
03:13:26 THAT. WE DON'T NEED TO DO THIS 
03:13:32 THIS DOES NOTHING FOR THE SOUTH SIDE. 
03:13:33 AND NOTHING FOR THE WEST SIDE 
03:13:37 ALL WAS BROUGHT UP BUILDINGS ARE BURNED 
03:13:38 DOWN THEY'RE STILL THERE AT 
03:13:43 THE TIME WHERE OUR PRIORITIES SHOULD BE 
03:13:44 AND THE BIG DEVELOPMENT NOT ON 
03:13:47 THE NORTH SIDE WE'RE. OKAY. WE TALKED 
03:13:48 ABOUT EQUITY IN THE MAYOR'S 
03:13:54 CAMPAIGN AND TALKED ABOUT THE TALE OF 
03:13:55 TWO CITIES THAT HAPPENS OVER 
03:14:00 TIME LIKE TODAY AND TODAY LIKE TODAY. 
03:14:01 OUR CITY GETS EXCITE WE HAVE A 
03:14:07 CHOICE TODAY THIS IS ON THE SOUTH SIDE 
03:14:08 OR THE WEST SIDE MY VOTE WILL 
03:14:13 BE DIFFERENT BUT IT IS NOT ON THE NORTH 
03:14:14 SIDE. I WANT TO JUST TO BE 
03:14:17 CLEAR THIS IS A RICH GETTING RICHER THE 
03:14:18 NORTH SIDE GETTING NETTER AND 
03:14:23 FOR US TO TAKE A VOTE AGAINST IT TODAY, 
03:14:24 WE'RE GOING TO GET A BETTER 
03:14:32 DEAL I BELIEVE THAT I REALLY BELIEVE 
03:14:33 THAT I ASK YOU TO VOTE NO. 
03:14:37 >> ALDERMAN. 
03:14:43 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
03:14:44 >> ACTUALLY ALDERMAN BURNETTE DID AN 
03:14:45 EXCELLENT JOB OF 
03:14:50 PULVERIZING - THIS INFORMATION AND THE 
03:14:51 IGNORANCE HOW THIS OPERATES AS 
03:15:10 ALDERMAN BURNETTE POINTED OUT THAT IS 
03:15:11 MONEY TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE THE 
03:15:19 PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE CITY'S 
03:15:20 INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THEY ONLY 
03:15:25 GET PAID BACK IF ENOUGH MONEY IS THE 
03:15:26 RESULT OF THE DEVELOPMENT THEY'RE 
03:15:31 THE ONES AT RISK. WE DON'T HAVE THE 
03:15:32 MONEY TO FRONT THIS 
03:15:37 INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS IS A WAY THAT WE 
03:15:38 MOVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
03:15:43 DEAL WITH CONTAMINATEED LAND YOU HAVE 
03:15:44 TO CLOSE A BILLION DOLLARS GAP. 
03:16:01 WHAT WE OWE THE PENSION FUND TO MAKE 
03:16:02 THEM SOUND BY THE END OF THE 2020 
03:16:10 IS WHERE WILL SAY MONEY COME FROM? 
03:16:11 WHERE WILL WE FIND ONE MILLION 
03:16:17 DOLLARS YOU COME UP WITH VERY FEW 
03:16:18 PEOPLE COME UP WITH ANSWERS. ONE 
03:16:22 WAY WE CAN COME UP WITH THE PORTION OF 
03:16:23 THAT MONEY SO GOOD OUR ECONOMY. 
03:16:27 WE CAN'T CUT AND CAN'T TAX OUR WAY OUT 
03:16:28 OF THIS PROBLEM WE HAVE TO GROW 
03:16:33 OUR ECONOMY AND WHERE IS THIS TAKE 
03:16:34 PLACE IT IS TAKE PLACE A LOT ON THE 
03:16:38 NORTH SIDE. THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE TO 
03:16:39 ENCOURAGE GROWTH ON THE SOUTH 
03:16:43 SIDE. BUT IF THE GROWTH ON THE NORTH 
03:16:44 SIDE WOULDN'T HAPPEN BUT FOR THE 
03:16:51 TIFF IT WILL NOT HAPPEN WE WALK AWAY 
03:16:52 FROM HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF 
03:17:01 DOLLARS DOLLARS OF REVENUE. THIS 
03:17:02 DEVELOPMENT WILL TAKE. AND THAT 
03:17:06 REVENUE IS NOT GOING TO STAY WITHIN THE 
03:17:07 CONFINES OF THE TIFF WILL 
03:17:11 BENEFIT THE ENTIRE CITY ALDERMEN'S WARD 
03:17:12 MY WARD I DECIDE CITY WILL 
03:17:21 FUND THE POLICE AND FIRE AND SCHOOLS 
03:17:22 AND HOPEFULLY HELP MITIGATE SOME 
03:17:27 OF THE THINGS WE'LL FACE TO MAKE THE 
03:17:28 PENSION FUND SOLID. SO LET'S TRY 
03:17:35 TO STEER AWAY FROM IN ENTIRE THING 
03:17:36 ABOUT TIFFS AND THE DEVELOPERS AND 
03:17:40 ALL THAT. THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE THE 
03:17:41 DEVELOPER IS A IN FRONT OF THE 
03:17:45 MONEY FOR US. THEY'RE TAKING THE RISK. 
03:17:46 IF THE TIFF DIDN'T PERFORM AS 
03:17:52 ANTICIPATED AND THE ECONOMY GOES INTO 
03:17:53 THE TANK FOR AWHILE THEY'RE ON 
03:17:56 THE HOOK NOT US IT IS A GOOD DEAL FOR 
03:17:57 THE TAXPAYERS I URGE YOU YOU TO 
03:18:02 VOTE. 
03:18:03 >> ALDERMAN LOPEZ. 
03:18:06 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. IT IS 
03:18:07 AMAZING TO ME SITTING 
03:18:09 HERE SOMEONE FROM SOUTHWEST SIDE 
03:18:10 CASUALLY SAY THE JOBS ARE FINE THAT'S 
03:18:20 NOT AN ISSUE ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. 
03:18:21 WE'VE HEARD THE SOMETHING ELSE 5 
03:18:25 TIMES NOW. AFFORDABILITY AND GREEN 
03:18:26 SPACE AND YOU NAME IT. LET'S WAIT 
03:18:32 LET'S WAIT LET'S WAIT. IN THE MEANTIME, 
03:18:33 AWHILE EVERYONE IS REFERENCED 
03:18:38 THE BROWN AND BLACK COMMUNITY, I HAPPEN 
03:18:39 TO REPRESENT THEM. ALMOST 
03:18:44 EQUALLY. I CAN TELL YOU THAT I'VE MET 
03:18:45 ALMOST A DOZENS OF LABORS 
03:18:52 TRADES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN BUILDING 
03:18:53 THE NEW NEIGHBORHOOD. RE THEIR 
03:18:57 EXISTED FOR COMING SOUTHWEST TO WEST 
03:18:58 INGLEWOOD AND GAGE PARK ALL THE 
03:19:04 NEIGHBORHOODS 82 YOU ALL TALK ABOUT. TO 
03:19:05 START RECRUITING AND HIRING 
03:19:10 AND PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK TO BUILD THE 
03:19:11 NEWEST NEIGHBORHOOD TO BE 
03:19:15 AMONGST THE TONE THOUSAND NEW JOBS THAT 
03:19:16 WILL BE CREATED MIND NOT TO 
03:19:20 MENTION THE PERMANENT ONES STILL. IT 
03:19:21 MUST BE NICE FROM A POINT OF 
03:19:31 PRIVILEGE SO IS DON'T RUSH. I 
03:19:32 UNDERSTAND THERE IS PHILOSOPHY MATTERS 
03:19:38 AND POLITICAL MATTERS BUT IT IS ALL A 
03:19:39 PILE OF BS AT THE END OF THE 
03:19:45 DAY, THERE ARE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE 
03:19:46 PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING AND 
03:19:48 NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO THEIR 
03:19:49 CHILDREN WILL GO TO SELLING 
03:19:53 DRUGS AND CRIME. WE HAVE THE 
03:19:54 OPPORTUNITY TO PUT THEM ON TRACK FOR THE 
03:20:00 MIDDLE-CLASS WE ALL CARE ABOUT WHAT IS 
03:20:01 THE NEXT SOLUTION TO GIVE? AND 
03:20:06 NO OFFENSE TO ANYONE THAT SAYS THIS BUT 
03:20:07 YOU'LL NOT COME THROUGH 
03:20:14 SOMETHING IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS AND 
03:20:15 GENTRIFY. THIS IS SOMETHING HAS 
03:20:21 THINK PLANNED AND TALKED ABOUT FOR 
03:20:22 NEARLY HALF A DECADE? ALDERMAN 
03:20:30 HOPKINS AROUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
03:20:31 SITE AND OTHER DEVELOPERS WANT 
03:20:34 TO COME TO OUR NECK OF THE ONE SIDE AND 
03:20:35 HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AM I 
03:20:42 RIGHT WE'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TALK 
03:20:43 ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU I GUARANTEE 
03:20:46 WE'LL SEE NOT ONLY PRESERVES OUR 
03:20:47 RESIDENTS SO WE CAN ALL ABOUT THERE 
03:20:54 AND EASY TO SAY THROUGH IT SOMEWHERE 
03:20:55 ELSE BUT I THINK ALDERMAN HOPKINS 
03:21:00 HAS DONE THAT THE RESOURCES THAT WILL 
03:21:01 CREATE HAVE SEEN THE 
03:21:07 NEIGHBORHOOD THE OPPORTUNITY IN WEST 
03:21:08 SIDE ANKLE WOOD AND IN THE PARK 
03:21:15 WE'LL HAVE THE SUPERVISORIAL CORD IN 
03:21:16 THE BACKYARD ON 57 STREET CAN 
03:21:21 BENEFIT. REAL BENEFITS TO THE CITY OF 
03:21:22 CHICAGO MR. PRESIDENT NO MORE 
03:21:35 DETAILS I URGE YOU THE COLLEAGUES TO 
03:21:36 REJECT THE POLITICAL THEATRE AND 
03:21:39 GET THE JOB DONE. THANK YOU. 
03:21:43 >> 
03:21:44 (GAVEL) 
03:21:47 >> ALDERMAN. 
03:21:48 >> BEFORE YOU AND I SPOKE I WAS FLAT 
03:21:49 NO, BUT I'LL WILLING 
03:21:57 TO MEET YOU HALFWAY. I'M AGAINST THE 
03:21:58 TIFF THE ONE $. BILLION 
03:22:09 SUBSIDIES THAT BUILDER GETS NOT IN THIS 
03:22:10 ITEM THIS IS STRICTLY A VOTING 
03:22:15 MATTER BUT I'M TELLING YOU I LOOK AT 
03:22:16 THE NEXT FOUR YEARS I'LL DO 
03:22:22 EVERYTHING IN MY POWER AS AN ALDERMEN 
03:22:23 IF WE DON'T APPROACH THIS AMOUNT 
03:22:28 OF MONEY. IF YOU DRIVE IF YOU LOOK AT 
03:22:29 THE ROADS AND IN DISREPAIR AND 
03:22:36 LOOK AT THE ALLEYS THOSE HAVE NOT BEEN 
03:22:37 TAKEN CARE OF FOR MANY, MANY 
03:22:43 GREATS TIME FOR THE CITY FOR MANY, MANY 
03:22:44 YEARS - FOR US TO FUND ONE 
03:22:53 $.6 MILLION TO BUILD WHILE THE REST OF 
03:22:54 THE CITY HAS NOT SEEN PROGRESS 
03:23:01 AT ALL IS NOT PRACTICAL. I DO AGREE 
03:23:02 THIS IS A SONY MATTER FOR THE 
03:23:11 PROJECT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE 
03:23:12 ADDITIONAL LIGHT HAD WILL WORK AND 
03:23:15 NOT WORK. I'M TRYING TO SEPARATE - I 
03:23:16 HAVE SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ON 
03:23:25 WITH MY OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID. 
03:23:26 ALDERMAN SMITH TALKED ABOUT THIS 
03:23:33 PROJECT HAS MOVED FORWARD A LITTLE BIT 
03:23:34 MORE AND LESS SCALE BUT NO 
03:23:40 SUBSEQUENCE. AND IF HER COMMUNITY HAS 
03:23:41 RESERVATIONS WHY I LOOK AT THIS 
03:23:45 FROM THIS END. THE BIGGEST RESERVATION 
03:23:46 IS THE MONEY THE BRIDGES. THE 
03:23:51 HIGH-END AMENITIES THIS COMMUNITY WILL 
03:23:52 SUGGEST WITH NO EXTENSION FROM 
03:23:57 US. SO AS WE LOOK AT TO THE NEXT FOUR 
03:23:58 YEARS SOME OF US IN OUR 
03:24:04 POSITIONS IT IS NO LONGER ABOUT A ABOUT 
03:24:05 IDEOLOGY BUT GOVERNING I 
03:24:11 UNDERSTAND THAT. THE HUGE 
03:24:12 RESPONSIBILITY THE NEXT MAYOR WILL GET 
03:24:13 MY 
03:24:21 RESPONSIBILITY AND MY DAUGHTER 7 AND 13 
03:24:22 YEARS OLD. I DON'T TAKE THAT 
03:24:26 LIGHTLY. WHEN I VOTED "NO" I MEANT I 
03:24:27 MEANT IT. BECAUSE THIS IS 
03:24:33 DISCUSSION NEEDS TO BE HAD NOT ONLY 
03:24:34 TODAY OR TOMORROW AND THE NEXT 
03:24:39 MEETING MORE AND MORE OF IT. I'M GLAD 
03:24:40 THE NEXT MAYOR OR NEXT 
03:24:45 REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE MAYOR WILL TALK 
03:24:46 ABOUT THIS COUNCIL HOW TO 
03:24:51 WE'RE GOING TO SEPARATE THIS AND 
03:24:52 LEGISLATE I'M GLAD WE'RE HAVING THIS 
03:24:59 DISCUSSION. 
03:25:00 >> SO LET'S NOT JUST GIGGLE AND LAUGH 
03:25:01 ABOUT YES, WE SAID NO, 
03:25:05 BUT WE MUST BE AT THE TABLE I'M NOT 
03:25:06 GLIMPSE I AGAINST I MR. MAYOR AND 
03:25:16 I TALK AND YOU'RE A SERIOUS MAN OF 
03:25:17 SERIOUS BUSINESS NOT ONLY LOCALLY 
03:25:22 BUT PEOPLE RESPECT I RESPECT YOU AND 
03:25:23 GIVEN YOU THIS PROJECT WILL GET 
03:25:28 BETTER NOT LESS NOT MORE BUT BETTER, 
03:25:29 BETTER IN ADJUSTMENT FOR OTHER 
03:25:33 COMMUNITY I'LL NOT STOP UNTIL THAT 
03:25:34 HAPPENS IF I HAVE TO VOTE AGAINST 
03:25:38 THIS I'LL VOTE AGAINST EVERYTHING I'LL 
03:25:39 DO SO. BUT PLEASE TAKE NOTE 
03:25:46 I'M NOT VOTING FOR TIFF. IN CHALLENGES 
03:25:47 IN THE CITY AND THE OTHER PART 
03:25:55 OF THE CITY YOU'RE GOING TO GET OUR 
03:25:56 MONEY AND YOUR INVESTMENT WE'RE 
03:25:58 GOING TO MAKE SURE OF THAT. RESPECT 
03:25:59 YOU. 
03:26:11 >> ALDERMAN PEOPLE DO BETTER AND ALSO 
03:26:12 THIS COMMON SENSE IS 
03:26:21 NOT ALWAYS COMMON. WE TALK ABOUT TIFF 
03:26:22 AND I'M NOT EDUCATED OPEN IT 
03:26:29 SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE PEOPLE LOTS OF 
03:26:30 GIVEN THINGS TO PEOPLE JUST TO 
03:26:36 FEEL I KNOW WHEN IT LET'S TO THE SOUTH 
03:26:37 HE I MEAN THE WEST SIDE WE HEAR 
03:26:40 THAT ON THE NORTH SIDE IT BECOMES A 
03:26:41 DIRTY WORD. BUT WHILE WORKING AND 
03:26:48 LISTENING AND GETTING GETTING INTO THE 
03:26:49 WEEDS OF THIS IT ALL MAKES 
03:26:54 SENSE THE FACT THAT THE TIFF MONEY WILL 
03:26:55 NOT BE USED FOR JUST BUILDING 
03:27:02 AT ALL AND WHAT ALDERMAN BURNETTE SAID 
03:27:03 WITHOUT REPEATING IF IT IS NOT 
03:27:08 BUILT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TIFF TO GENERATE 
03:27:09 IN ORDER TO DO THE 
03:27:14 INFRASTRUCTURE I WANT TO ADD NOT 
03:27:15 AGAINST A CAPITAL BILL FROM THE STATE 
03:27:19 OF ILLINOIS. THAT CAPITA MONEY WILL NOT 
03:27:20 HAPPEN DO DO ANY 
03:27:25 INFRASTRUCTURE WORK. WE'RE TO BUCKLE 
03:27:26 MORE IF WE STANLEY TALK ABOUT 
03:27:32 THAT MONEY FROM THE STATE TO THE 
03:27:33 COMMUNITY. PEOPLE HAVE TO LOOK AT 
03:27:35 THIS IN A TOTALITY. I'M WANTING TO 
03:27:36 THANK SHELLY FOR LISTENING AND 
03:27:46 FOR MAKING SURE THAT THERE 
03:27:47 PARTICIPATION FOR THE SOUTH SIDE AND 
03:27:48 WHAT 
03:27:52 ARE WE GOING TO DO IN PARTICULAR OF THE 
03:27:53 AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. 
03:27:54 BUT I HEARD ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT 
03:27:55 WAIT. AND I'M NOT GOING TO SAY 
03:27:59 TWO THINGS BEFORE I STATE MY CASE. THIS 
03:28:00 IS NOT A JEWEL, IN NOT A 
03:28:07 COMMON IF THEY'RE TRYING TO BUILD ON 
03:28:08 THE NORTH SIDE AND NOT COMING TO 
03:28:11 THE SOUTH SIDE OR THE WEST SIDE MR. 
03:28:12 MAYOR TELL THEM NO BUILD OVER HERE 
03:28:17 FIRST AND IF THEY WALK AWAY I TRUST 
03:28:18 THAT THIS WILL BE PEACEFUL. I 
03:28:24 CAN'T WAIT AND DO ACTION AND NOT TRUST 
03:28:25 THAT $8 MILLION WILL NOT WALK 
03:28:29 AWAY AM THAT'S A RISK WE'RE TAKING. AND 
03:28:30 NO DOUBT YES, WE CAN WHEEZE 
03:28:36 THEM FOR MORE BUT AGAIN IS THAT RISK 
03:28:37 VERSUS AWARD SO SOMETHING A A 
03:28:51 BIRD IN HAND IS BETTER THAN TWO IN THE 
03:28:52 BUSH I'M TOTALLY IN SUPPORT OF 
03:28:53 THIS AS IT BENEFITS THE COMMUNITIES AND 
03:28:54 ESPECIALLY, WHEN IT COMES TO 
03:29:00 US BUILDING OUR COMMUNITY WITH THE GAP 
03:29:01 FUNDING TO HAVE THOSE COMPANIES 
03:29:04 HELP US WITH THE GAP FUNDS. THANK YOU 
03:29:05 VERY MUCH. MR. PRESIDENT. 
03:29:07 >> 
03:29:08 (GAVEL) 
03:29:12 ALDERMAN MORENO. 
03:29:13 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.. I WANT TO 
03:29:14 SENATOR MANNING 
03:29:20 ALDERMAN RAMIREZ-ROSA AND SUMMED UP 
03:29:21 THIS AND IN IS ON OLD TRICK PLACED 
03:29:40 ON AN OLD DOG. WE REQUEST AGAIN FOR 23 
03:29:41 YEARS BY CREATING A TIFF WHO 
03:29:53 WILL BUS THAT MONEY AND ALDERMAN IS 
03:29:54 HERE IN THIS YEARS GOD BLESS YOU. 
03:30:02 WE BOTTLE UP THE MONEY AND PAY THE 
03:30:03 DEVELOPERS TO FRONT THIS YEAH 
03:30:08 THEY'LL FRONT THE MONEY AND 4 HUNDRED 
03:30:09 PLUS BILLION DOLLARS IS THE 
03:30:13 INTEREST WE PAY ON THAT. WE DONE THIS 
03:30:14 BEFORE OVER AND OVER AGAIN NOPE 
03:30:23 THIS TIME IT WILL BE DIFFERENT NO 
03:30:24 DIFFERENCE. OLD TRICKS PLACED ON 
03:30:28 THE CONSTITUENTS THAT SPENT 8 YEARS 
03:30:29 TALKING ABOUT THIS A RARE 
03:30:36 OPPORTUNITY TO APPROACH THIS. BY TAKING 
03:30:37 WHAT WE DO ALDERMAN 
03:30:44 RAMIREZ-ROSA PILOTED AND BUILD THE 
03:30:45 INFRASTRUCTURE WILL HELP YOUR 
03:30:50 DEVELOPMENT BE SUCCESSFUL AND PAY FOR 
03:30:51 IT FROM THE REVENUE YOU GENERATE 
03:30:56 FOR THE UP ZONING THAT IS GOING ON. 
03:30:57 THERE ARE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
03:31:01 DOLLARS THAT ARE GOING TO FREE AGENCIES 
03:31:02 AND UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IS NOT 
03:31:06 GOING TO GO TO THE CITIZENS OF CHICAGO 
03:31:07 BUT TO THE DEVELOPER. AND NOT 
03:31:13 NECESSARILY SAY IT IS DONE. SO WE HAD 
03:31:14 AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPROACH THIS 
03:31:18 DIFFERENTLY AT A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL AND 
03:31:19 SAYING NOT SAME OLD THING BUT 
03:31:25 PUT A NEW NAME ON IT TODAY IT IS 
03:31:26 LINCOLN PARK AND GOD KNOWS WHAT WILL 
03:31:35 NAME BE. 
03:31:36 >> UNLESS WE APPROACH THIS DIFFERENTLY. 
03:31:37 SO I'VE HEARD 
03:31:40 TODAY, THE SAME THINGS I'VE HEARD FOR 8 
03:31:41 YEARS THERE IS A TABLE SCRAPE 
03:31:47 WILL FALL OFF THE MILLION DOLLARS AND 
03:31:48 $6 BILLION DEVELOPMENT LOGO TO 
03:31:54 ONE PART OF THE CITY. I JUST WISH WE 
03:31:55 WOULD SIT AT THE TABLE AND ALLOW 
03:32:02 OUR CONSTITUENTS OUR TAXPAYERS TO GET 
03:32:03 THE BENEFIT OF THE NEEDLE. BUT 
03:32:07 WE COMMUNITY-BASED AND DO THE SAME 
03:32:08 THING. 
03:32:11 >> THE AFFORDABILITY IS INTERESTING TO 
03:32:12 ME. JUST PROPOSED 
03:32:16 THERE WAS ZERO AFFORDABLE IN THE 
03:32:17 DEVELOPMENT. IN ONSITE IN LINCOLN 
03:32:22 PARK. SO WE NEGOTIATED IN ZERO AND 10 
03:32:23 PERCENT WHICH IS WHAT THE 
03:32:29 ORDINANCE SAYS 20 IF WE ARE 
03:32:30 SUBSIDIZING. I SHAKE ANY HEAD. THAT WAS 
03:32:37 WE SEE THAT AS AS WHIM. AND FOR THE 
03:32:38 OFFSITE IF OUR 3 MILES IN LINCOLN 
03:32:44 PARK YOU'RE NOT IN LINCOLN PARK. SO 
03:32:45 THAT DIDN'T PUT MORE AFFORDABLE 
03:32:49 HOUSING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IS 
03:32:50 NODDING IT AND NEVER GOING TO 
03:32:55 CATCH UP 600-UNIT OUT OF 6 THOUSAND. WE 
03:32:56 ARE SO FAR BEHIND ON THE 
03:33:03 AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WE NEED ACROSS 
03:33:04 THE CITY EVERY TIME WE TALK 
03:33:08 ABOUT THIS IN THE WIND EVERYBODY 
03:33:09 OUTSIDE OF THE CITY IS LAUGHING. SO 
03:33:17 THEATRICALS ZERO CONSTITUENTS IN THAT 
03:33:18 AREA. THE CONSTITUENTS THE 
03:33:21 VOTERS THE PEOPLE THE RESIDENTS AND 
03:33:22 NEIGHBORS ARE SUPPORTING - THIS 
03:33:28 WAS DRAWN SPECIFICALLY TO COVER AN 
03:33:29 INDUSTRIAL AREA ZERO - SO WELCOME 
03:33:35 TO THE SAME OLD GAME WITH A NEW NAME 
03:33:36 LINCOLN PARK AND LOST OPPORTUNITY 
03:33:41 FOR THIS OLD DID YOU GO TO PICK UP NEW 
03:33:42 TRICKS I'LL BE VOTING NO. 
03:33:47 >> ALDERMAN HARRISON. 
03:33:56 >> THANK YOU. MY COLLEAGUES TALKED IN 
03:34:04 [OFF MIC.] I AGREE WITH YOU ALDERMAN 
03:34:05 WE'RE SEEING THE SAME THING OVER 
03:34:10 AND OVER AGAIN WE HAVE TO STOP BEGGING 
03:34:11 FOR CRUMBS THEY GET A MILLION 
03:34:17 WE GET A LITTLE. NOT GOOD FOR THE CITY 
03:34:18 AND THE PEOPLE AND MANY OF YOU 
03:34:23 AT THE COUNCIL SAY THE SAME THING YOU 
03:34:24 SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT WHAT IS 
03:34:31 GOOD FOR US AND NOT BEEN GOOD SO STOP 
03:34:32 SAYING THAT AND THOSE OF YOU 
03:34:37 THAT RESORTED TO NAME-CALLING THAT IS 
03:34:38 NOT A WAY TO GET ANYTHING DONE. 
03:34:42 THIS IS NOT POLITICAL THEATRE IT IS 
03:34:43 THIS IS THE CITY OF CHICAGO WE 
03:34:49 REPRESENT THE PEOPLE IN THE CITY OF 
03:34:50 CHICAGO NOT THEATRE. THE ONLY 
03:34:54 THING THE THEATRE ABOUT THIS IS 
03:34:55 PERPETRATES THE MIGHT IN THAT A GOOD 
03:35:02 FOR THE CITY. WE TALK ABOUT THE 
03:35:03 REPRESENTATIVES AND WHAT OUR PEOPLE 
03:35:06 WANT AND INSTEAD TALK ABOUT CREATING A 
03:35:07 WHOLE NEW NEIGHBORHOOD WE HAVE 
03:35:14 A WHOLE BUNCH THAT NEED A LOT OF 
03:35:15 INVESTMENT. AND THOSE THAT WANT TO 
03:35:21 QUESTION THE CITY. THIS IS AROUND SINCE 
03:35:22 1970 IN SOUTHERN ILLINOIS NOT 
03:35:29 FOR THE CITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OF 
03:35:30 THIS HAS BEEN DOING THIS 
03:35:36 [OFF MIC.] PUT IN IN CHICAGO. AND WE 
03:35:37 FOUND WAYS TO TWIST THE LAW SO 
03:35:43 WE CAN HAVE A NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE LINCOLN 
03:35:44 PARK BE CONSIDERED BLIGHTED. 
03:35:49 REALLY? 
03:35:50 >> REALLY? 
03:35:51 >> BLIGHTED - BLIGHTED. THE CITY HAS 
03:35:52 CHOSEN TO VIOLATE 
03:36:05 AGAINST THE SOUTH SIDE THAT'S BEEN 
03:36:06 HISTORICAL AND IT TAKES THE RIGHT 
03:36:09 KIND OF LEADERSHIP. AS SOMEONE A LARGE 
03:36:10 RECIPIENT WHEN THEY TORE DOWN 
03:36:25 THE HOUSING PROJECT NOT EVERYONE CAME 
03:36:26 TO DO THEIR FAIR SHARE SO IT 
03:36:33 DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WE SHOULDN'T DO 
03:36:34 MORE. I JUST THINK THAT WE NEED TO 
03:36:43 TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE BRYAN I KNOW 
03:36:44 WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS IS NOT 
03:36:49 PERSON MY PEOPLE ARE CALLED. 
03:36:52 >> TALKED ABOUT IT BUT I JUST DON'T 
03:36:53 BELIEVE THAT IS A GOOD 
03:36:57 DEAL FOR THE CITY. LOOKING AT WHAT WE 
03:36:58 DON'T HAVE IN ECONOMIC JUSTICE 
03:37:02 AT LEAST IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. 
03:37:04 >> 
03:37:05 (GAVEL) 
03:37:07 >> ALDERMAN. 
03:37:08 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
03:37:09 >> IT IT WOULD BE NICE TO SIT ON 
03:37:10 THEATRE ROW WITH YOU ALL. 
03:37:21 LAKE MICHIGAN. BUT MUST BE REAL NICE TO 
03:37:22 GO UP THE HIGHWAY AND HAVE 
03:37:31 PHILANTHROPY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WAS 
03:37:32 GOOD THERAPY AND ACROSS THE CITY. 
03:37:38 BUT MUST BE REAL NICE WALKING TO THE 
03:37:39 GROCERY STORES. SIT ON OUR PORCH 
03:37:52 WE DON'T HAVE THOSE LURKS. IT IS THE 
03:37:53 CITY. SOME OF US DOES NOT HAVE 
03:37:59 THAT BUT YOU FEEL WHAT IS BASIC I'LL 
03:38:00 NEVER FORGOT THIS SOMEONE SAYS IN 
03:38:08 THE BODY OR SOMEONE IS TAKING X TOXICS 
03:38:09 OTHER OF THIS HOUSE AND PUTTING 
03:38:22 IT IN THE CAN SOME OF US DON'T HAVE 
03:38:23 THOSE LURKS. AND I DON'T WANT TO 
03:38:29 REITERATE THIS IN THE LAST I SAID THIS 
03:38:30 A ZONING MATTER IN A COMMUNITY 
03:38:38 WE TALK ABOUT THE CONTESTANTS FOR 
03:38:39 ANOTHER DAY LET'S UNDERSTAND HOW IT 
03:38:49 WORKS SOME OF IS HAVE BEEN HERE AT 
03:38:50 LEAST 4 YEARS AND HAD BASIC 
03:38:56 KNOWLEDGE OF HOW STUFF WORKS. 
03:38:57 INFRASTRUCTURE. 
03:39:03 >> CHURCH. 
03:39:04 >> THIS IS CHURCH. 
03:39:05 >> I'M NOT A PASTOR DON'T WORRY. 
03:39:09 >> INFRASTRUCTURE AFFORDABILITY ARE 
03:39:10 THING WE WOULD LIKE TO 
03:39:20 SEE ACROSS THE CITY YOU TALK ABOUT 3 
03:39:21 MILES. 3 MILES FROM LINCOLN PARK 
03:39:26 THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF SOMEONE 25 YEARS 
03:39:27 OLD AND 43 MILES AWAY IN 
03:39:35 LINCOLN PARK. IF THIS DEVELOPMENT CAN 
03:39:36 GENERATE POSITIVE OUTCOME 
03:39:42 ACROSS THE CITY IS AS ALDERMAN BURNETTE 
03:39:43 TALKED ABOUT WE'VE MET 
03:39:59 OBLIGATES IT WILL GENERATE DOLLARS 
03:40:00 LET'S NOT FORGOT HOW TIFF REALLY 
03:40:06 WORKS. AND IF IT DEVELOPMENT CAN DEAL 
03:40:07 AND HELP OTHER PARTS OF OUR 
03:40:15 CITY? OUR JOB. I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT 
03:40:16 PEOPLE SOMETIMES GET A LITTLE 
03:40:24 BIT PHILANTHROPY PERSON THAT DOES THOSE 
03:40:25 TYPES OF THINGS BUT NOT 
03:40:30 EVERYONE IS OF THE SAME POSITION. NOT 
03:40:31 ANYONE HAS THE SAME PLACE 
03:40:37 OPPORTUNITY AND ABILITY IF LINCOLN PARK 
03:40:38 CAN HELP PEOPLE AND RESIDENTS 
03:40:45 AND EAST GARFIELD AND MONODALE AND ROSE 
03:40:46 IF THIS CAN HELP, LET'S HELP 
03:40:53 IF THIS IS GOING TO HURT THE RESIDENTS 
03:40:54 THAT'S A DIFFERENT 
03:40:57 CONVERSATION. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT FENCES 
03:40:58 AND ALL THOSE THINGS, HOWEVER, 
03:41:01 WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WE FACE THIS ABOARD 
03:41:02 MADE YEARS AGO PROBABLY MANY 
03:41:09 HAVE NOT BEEN HERE. BUT I'LL SAY THIS 
03:41:10 AND THIS IS CRITICAL. THAT 
03:41:18 THIS IS AUTISM AND AGAIN, I WOULD LIKE 
03:41:19 TO SEE THE AFFORDABILITY THAT 
03:41:23 STARTED THAT IS NOW AT 6 HOMICIDE BUT 
03:41:24 AGAIN AFFORDABLE IN YOUR 
03:41:33 COMMUNITY MARKS SOME OF OURS. IF WE CAN 
03:41:34 BUILD ONE HUNDRED NEW HOUSES 
03:41:40 IN EAST GARFIELD PARK AND HUMBLE PARK 
03:41:41 WOULDN'T THAT PASS A POSITIVE 
03:41:47 IMPACT ON THE RESIDENTS? IF WE CAN 
03:41:48 BUILD AFFORDABLE UNITS AND TRYING 
03:41:54 TO HELP THE COMMUNITIES WOULDN'T THAT 
03:41:55 HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE 
03:42:00 PARTICIPATION SO AGAIN LET'S SEE HOW 
03:42:01 RISE TIED EXIST BUT MAY NOT HAVE 
03:42:08 A DIRECT IMPACT ON WHERE YOU ARE AND 
03:42:09 AGAIN, IT WOULD BE NICE REAL NICE 
03:42:17 TO HAVE TIME FOR PHILOSOPHY 
03:42:18 CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU HAVE UNITS ARE 
03:42:29 BENEFITS. AND I DON'T REGARD 
03:42:30 DEVELOPMENT IN COMMUNITY AS MY 
03:42:38 COLLEAGUES STATED BEFORE WE WERE BORN 
03:42:39 BURNED DOWN. AS SCRATCH TO YOU 
03:42:49 MAY BE BUT MAYBE SCRAP TO YOU BECAUSE 
03:42:50 YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOUR 
03:42:54 COMMUNITY NEEDS THAT WITH ALDERMAN AND 
03:42:55 SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES ARE 
03:43:01 TRYING TO FIT MONEY TO PAVE THE WORLD 
03:43:02 IN OTHER COMMUNITIES PUTTING UP 
03:43:08 MURALS AND DOING ALL KINDS OF STUFF. 
03:43:09 WITH THEIR MONEY WE ARE TRYING 
03:43:15 TO GET PAST - 
03:43:17 >> ALL RIGHT. SORRY. 
03:43:18 >> I WANT EVERYBODY TO STEP BACK AND 
03:43:19 THINK ABOUT HOW WOULD 
03:43:24 THAT EFFECT EVERYBODY NOT JUST YOUR 
03:43:25 STYLE. YOUR WORLD. YOUR 
03:43:32 WHATEVER. BUT HOW IT CAN HELP SOMEONE 
03:43:33 ELSE. THANK YOU. 
03:43:38 >> I WANT TO THANK RABBI IRVING. 
03:43:44 >> ALDERMAN WAGUESPACK. 
03:43:49 >> WE'RE NOT VOTING ON TIFF ARE WE? 
03:43:52 >> FOR THE ONLY VOTING ON ZONING. 
03:43:55 >> OKAY. I'LL STICK TO ZONING. 
03:43:58 >> TIFF WILL COME UP THAT ADDRESSES THE 
03:43:59 ISSUES ON THE OTHER 
03:44:04 SIDE OF THE EQUATION IF WE WANT TO 
03:44:05 CHANGE THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IS 
03:44:09 WHERE THE VOTE WILL COUNT. TODAY'S VOTE 
03:44:10 IS ABOUT VOTING AND AS YOU 
03:44:16 MAY KNOW, I USED TO HAVE A PLACE IN THE 
03:44:17 AREA AS ALDERMAN POINTED OUT 
03:44:24 COME BACK WITH THE LAND AND PORTIONS OF 
03:44:25 THAT AREA WASN'T THAT I 
03:44:29 COULDN'T GET OUT OF THAT THE ZONING 
03:44:30 THAT WAS HERE AND WHAT HAPPENED IN 
03:44:37 THE PHARYNX WAS A BAD ZONING AN URBAN 
03:44:38 MCLAREN PARK. KNOWING WHAT THAT 
03:44:45 AREA IS LIKE KNOWING WHAT THE RESIDENTS 
03:44:46 IN THAT AREA LIKE AND KNOWING 
03:44:49 WHAT THE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE FOUGHT FOR 
03:44:50 THIS WAS NOT THE RIGHT DEAL NOT 
03:44:55 THE RIGHT DEAL THAT'S IT THANK YOU, MR. 
03:44:56 PRESIDENT AND ALDERMAN 
03:45:04 HOPKINS. 
03:45:05 >> HOLD ON I'M SORRY. 
03:45:07 >> ALMOST. 
03:45:09 >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. AND I 
03:45:10 WANTED TO TALK ABOUT A 
03:45:17 LITTLE BIT OF THIS PLANNING PROCESS FOR 
03:45:18 OUR CITY AND HOW IT HAS 
03:45:23 EVOLVED OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS. IN YOUR 
03:45:24 VISION I SAT ON THE PLANNING 
03:45:30 COMMISSION AND SEE WHAT WE ARE DOING IN 
03:45:31 THE PLACE. I'M FORTUNATE TO 
03:45:37 LIVE AND YOUR VISION AND MANY OF YOU 
03:45:38 HAVE APPROVED SO MANY 
03:45:42 DEVELOPMENTS ALONG THE RIVER FRONT FROM 
03:45:43 78 RIVER CITY EVEN BACK IN THE 
03:45:50 DAY OF ILLINOIS. AND THIS PMMD ERA HAS 
03:45:51 BEEN CHANGED FROM IS BUILT 
03:46:05 AREA TO THE NEW USES THAT ARE COMING 
03:46:06 THERE. THIS IS NOT NOW YOU VOTED 
03:46:14 PHOBIA SUBSIDIZED OF LAND ALONG THE 
03:46:15 CHICAGO RIVER 82 LAKE FRONT. I 
03:46:21 WANT TO SAY FIRST COMPLIMENT ALL THE 
03:46:22 MAJORITY SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE - 
03:46:28 THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, YOU KNOW, IS 
03:46:29 IMPORTANT ARGUMENT. THAT 
03:46:36 EFFECT EVERY SINGLE ORDINANCE. YOU 
03:46:37 KNOW, WHEN I TALKED TO THE 
03:46:42 DEVELOPERS AT STERLING BAY - I THINK MY 
03:46:43 CURRENT PROBLEM I'VE ALLUDED 
03:47:01 TO MAYOR I CAN'T GET AROUND THE 
03:47:02 DEPARTMENT FROM DIVERSITY TO BUCK TOWN 
03:47:07 WITHOUT A 45-MINUTE ON A GOOD DAY 
03:47:08 ALDERMAN MORENO ALDERMAN MORENO 
03:47:15 INVITED ME TO HIS OFFICE TO DINER NOT 
03:47:16 DURING RUSH HOUR. WE ARE 
03:47:23 REIMAGINING WHAT USED TO BE INDUSTRIAL 
03:47:24 DEAD END STREETS AND HE REALLY 
03:47:31 THINK THIS LEGITIMATE PLAN LA TAKE 
03:47:32 GETTING AROUND TOWN GETTING TO THE 
03:47:39 WEST SIDE OF CHICAGO AND FULLERTON AND 
03:47:40 GETTING BOTH PORTLAND WE HAVE 
03:47:49 TO DO THIS THIS IS WHAT THIS IS 
03:47:50 DEVELOPMENT WE WOULD NOT SEE THAT 
03:47:57 DEVELOPMENT FOR A LOT. LIKE 10 YEARS. I 
03:47:58 KNOW THE 78 THAT WAS 
03:48:05 NOTHING. THAT VERY, VERY PRIME PROPERTY 
03:48:06 HAS SAT VACANT 40 YEARS. 
03:48:12 WITHOUT 78. RIVER CITY WAS ONE 
03:48:13 DEVELOPMENT THAT STOOD EMPTY IT WAS 
03:48:21 HARD TO RENT NOW HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT 
03:48:22 IS DEVELOPED WITH THOSE ON THE 
03:48:28 PLANNING COMMISSION KNOW REBUILDING THE 
03:48:29 WALL AND WATER TAXES AND DOING 
03:48:34 ALL THE GOOD STUFF LOTS OF DOLLARS IN 
03:48:35 HERE. I WANT TO SAY AND GREW UP 
03:48:40 IN THE REALTIME AND MY PARENTS IN REAL 
03:48:41 ESTATE WE TOOK THE ILLINOIS 
03:48:50 CENTER TO 45 YEARS HAD A GOLF COURSE ON 
03:48:51 THE ILLINOIS CENTER WE SHOULD 
03:48:54 HAVE HAD LONG BUILDINGS. AND BY THE 
03:48:55 WAY, RECENTLY, WE OPENED UP THAT 
03:49:01 40-YEAR-OLD DEVELOPMENT TO GIVE THE 
03:49:02 TOWER I AROUND 
03:49:08 [OFF MIC.] THE 50 STORIES WITH THAT 
03:49:09 DEVELOPMENT. I REALLY GET UPSET 
03:49:14 ABOUT THE STERLING BAY ALL ABOUT - THIS 
03:49:15 IS RISK TIME IN THE STATE 
03:49:39 MARKET. I CAN SEE YOU DO THIS WE'LL SEE 
03:49:40 A CYCLE IN OUR LIFETIME I 
03:49:46 DON'T KNOW IT IS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE 
03:49:47 BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT REALLY LOW 
03:49:51 INCOME RATES. SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE 
03:49:52 TIFF BUT WE AS A CITY AND YOU 
03:49:58 AS YOU COUNCIL REALLY AUTHORIZED THE 
03:49:59 KIND OF DEVELOPMENT TO CREATE THE 
03:50:05 NEW TYPE OF NEIGHBORHOOD I THOUGHT I 
03:50:06 HEARD ABOUT THIS 6 THOUSAND 
03:50:08 RESIDENT THIS IS NOT 6 THOUSAND 
03:50:09 RESIDENT WE'RE DOING A FAR PIECE OKAY. 
03:50:15 AND IF THERE'S ONE COMPANY IN THE CITY 
03:50:16 THAT IS ABLE TO EXTRACT OFFICE 
03:50:24 TENANTS AND COMMERCIAL THAT IS STERLING 
03:50:25 BAY SO I'M LOOKING AT - IF 
03:50:48 THEY'RE GOING TO BUILD THE 
03:50:49 INFRASTRUCTURE THEY CAN GET AROUND TOWN, 
03:50:53 ETC. I THINK I FEEL THAT, YOU KNOW, I

03:51:02 AND CLOSE IS GOING TO BE - I GREW UP IN 
03:51:03 THE CITY. MY BUSINESS IS IN 
03:51:14 THE CITY. WHAT I WANT TO TELL ALDERMAN 
03:51:15 MY DEAR FRIEND GOOD LOOK AT 
03:51:26 NEW YORK AND THEY ARE BUILDING THE 
03:51:27 CENTRAL SUBWAY AND THAT'S WHAT I 
03:51:33 LOOK AT I DON'T LOOK AT THIS TOWN WE 
03:51:34 NEED TO EXTRADITE WITH NEW YORK 
03:51:38 AND -- EXCUSE-ME. WE NEED TO BE A 
03:51:39 WORLD-CLASS CITY AND IF STERLING BAY 
03:51:46 BRINGS US THERE I HOPE THAT IS WHAT 
03:51:47 HAPPENS IT IS ABOUT AND THAT'S 
03:51:52 WHERE JOE MOORE AND I AGREE; RIGHT? JOE

03:52:54 WE BELIEVE YOU'RE DOING YOUR 
03:52:59 JOB AND I AM. I ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE 
03:53:00 MY COLLEAGUES TALKING ABOUT THE 
03:53:05 TIFF I STARTED MY REMARKS THAT ALL THIS 
03:53:06 IS I DID THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T 
03:53:11 WANT TO GET INTO THE DISCUSSION WE'LL 
03:53:12 HAVE THIS DISCUSSION LATTER. I 
03:53:18 APPRECIATE TALKING ABOUT SHEDDING THE 
03:53:19 LIGHT BECAUSE THERE IS SO MANY 
03:53:25 MISINFORMATION OUT THERE ON THE REQUEST 
03:53:26 SOME OF IT, YOU KNOW, BUT 
03:53:32 UNFORTUNATELY 
03:53:33 [OFF MIC.] BECAUSE THEY OPPOSE THIS IS 
03:53:34 OUT RIGHT WE'LL BE TALKING 
03:53:38 ABOUT IF THAT YOU DID FUTURE. I WANTED 
03:53:39 TO SAY THAT WHY ISN'T THE 
03:53:44 DEVELOPER PAYING FOR SOME OF THIS? 
03:53:46 >> THEY ARE. THEY ARE, WE'RE SPENDING 
03:53:47 $440 BILLION FOR THE 
03:53:55 TIFF THAT ARE THINGS THAT THE TAX 
03:53:56 DOLLARS ARE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR. 
03:54:03 NOT A SINGLE DISCLOSE FROM THE 
03:54:04 DEVELOPER, HOWEVER, IN ADDITION TO THE 
03:54:08 $470 MILLION $308 MILLION WILL BE PAID 
03:54:09 FOR BY THE DEVELOPER AND AGAIN, 
03:54:14 THIS ROADS AND THE SIDEWALKS AND THE 
03:54:15 RIVER WALK AND OTHER THINGS WE 
03:54:19 NEED IN THE AREA TO MAKE THAT 
03:54:20 DEVELOPMENT POSSIBLE. THIS STARTED WHEN 
03:54:25 THIS PLAN WAS PRESENTED OUTSTANDING 
03:54:26 VEILED IN JULY OF 2018. ALMOST 
03:54:32 EVERYTHING THAT IS DOCUMENTED WAS 
03:54:33 PRESENTED AT THIS TIME IT WAS NOT 
03:54:37 PRODUCED ON THE PAPER BUT ON THE 
03:54:38 WEBSITE AND TWO LARGE PUBLIC HEARINGS 
03:54:44 DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME AND IN 
03:54:45 ADDITION TO TWO LARGE COMMUNITY 
03:54:47 MEETINGS AND HELPED ATTEND BY 250 
03:54:48 PEOPLE. WE HAD OVER 60 SMALLER 
03:54:57 COMMUNITY MEETINGS ON THIS PROPOSAL. 
03:54:58 THAT INCLUDED NEIGHBORHOOD FOCUS 
03:55:01 GROUPS I HOVERED AND ONE-ON-ONE 
03:55:02 SECTIONS WITH THE DEVELOPMENTS AND THE 
03:55:08 NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION AND THE 
03:55:09 BROWNING AREA. THERE WAS SUFFICIENT 
03:55:11 TIME AND SUFFICIENT INVOLVEMENT FROM 
03:55:12 THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND EVERY SINGLE 
03:55:17 ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS WE'VE SEEN IN 
03:55:18 THE PROPOSAL THAT IS INTRODUCED 
03:55:20 IN JULY IS A DIRECT RESULT TO MAKE 
03:55:21 IMPROVEMENTS AND REQUEST TO MAKE 
03:55:27 THIS A BETTER PLAN. I STAND HERE TODAY 
03:55:28 THIS IS THE BEST PLAN AND THE 
03:55:33 FINAL PRODUCT THE RESULT OF THAT 
03:55:34 PROCESS I NEED OUR VOTE.

03:59:22 NUMBERS. NOW IF YOU THAT TO SOLVE A LOT 
03:59:23 OF PROBLEMS I'LL STILL 
03:59:28 BUILDING IN GROWTH. FEW A LOT OF PEOPLE 
03:59:29 AND A LOT OF MONEY TALKED 
03:59:33 ABOUT NEW YORK. EX-CALLED HUDSON YARD 
03:59:34 HUDSON YARD DIDN'T IN THE 
03:59:42 PRODUCE $92 MILLION IN NEIGHBORHOODS 
03:59:43 OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THIS IS THE 
03:59:46 HARD PART OF NEW YORK BRINGING 100 
03:59:47 BUSINESSES AND COFFEE SHOPS AND 
03:59:52 RESTAURANTS AND BEACHES. AND SUITS. 
03:59:53 BROWN SUGAR ALL NOW ARE 
03:59:59 EXPANDING AND REBUILDING AND NOW 
04:00:00 OPENING UP A NEW NEIGHBORHOOD. 
04:00:06 HUDSON YARD DIDN'T CREATE THE TYPES OF 
04:00:07 FUNDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 
04:00:10 PERFECT JOBS BUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. 
04:00:11 AND LIKE TO NOTE WE'VE CHANGED 
04:00:16 POLICY HERE THAT WAS DEVELOPMENT AND 
04:00:17 ECONOMIC GROWTH AND IF YOU STAYED 
04:00:21 IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IT DIDN'T IT WENT 
04:00:22 TO OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS AND 
04:00:25 BECOME BECAME A CONVERTER TO OTHER 
04:00:26 BUSINESSES WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
04:00:32 AND THOSE WHO ADVOCATED NOT JUST 
04:00:33 WANTING TO HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON 
04:00:37 THE NORTH SIDE AND WEST SIDE HERE ALL 
04:00:38 ARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND YOU 
04:00:41 VOTE NOT ONLY YOU TALK ABOUT MAKING 
04:00:42 SURE WE ADDRESS THE NEIGHBORHOODS 
04:00:46 NOW HAVE A HAVE THE $2 MILLION ON THE 
04:00:47 HARD-PRESSED NEIGHBORHOODS? 
04:00:52 >> SOME POINTS YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR 
04:00:53 ARGUMENT TO CONVERT YOUR 
04:01:00 OPINION AND SUCCEEDED IN AFFORDABLE 
04:01:01 HOUSING GOING AT PARTS OF THE CITY 
04:01:06 THAT ALSO HAVE REJECTED THEM AND HAVE 
04:01:07 TO SAY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN 
04:01:13 ONE PART A WAY OF MAKING SURE VOTERS 
04:01:14 AND ALL VOTE. THAT THAT'S NOT 
04:01:20 MEANSPIRITED IN THE STAFF YOU TAKE THE 
04:01:21 POLICIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 
04:01:25 SOME CITIES DO. $67 BILLION ACTUALLY 
04:01:26 STARTS TO BENEFIT AREAS THAT 
04:01:31 HAVE NOT SEEN ECONOMIC IMPACT FOR 
04:01:32 YEARS. AND THIS IS THE BIG CHANGE 
04:01:38 YOU ALL WERE PART OF MAKING THAT CHANGE 
04:01:39 FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT BECOME 
04:01:42 THE PLACE WHERE OTHER COMMUNITIES GET 
04:01:43 BENEFITS. I THINK THIS IS A 
04:01:48 STEP FORWARD AS NOTED AND TODAY WHETHER 
04:01:49 MS. ON THEIR CHINA TOWN OR WAY 
04:01:57 UP NORTH WE HAVE A WATERFRONT THAT IS 
04:01:58 NEVER BLIGHT TO BE AN ECONOMIC 
04:02:05 MACHINE AND TO ALL THE EFFORTS YOU WANT 
04:02:06 TO SEE MORE KIDS IN BAND 
04:02:12 PROGRAM IN THE SCHOOL YOU NEED ECONOMIC 
04:02:13 GROWTH. WHO WILL IT PROTECT? 
04:02:19 IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE TYPE OF 
04:02:20 TRANSPORTATION NOT RED LINE AND PURPLE 
04:02:27 LINE WE DIDN'T HAVE A TRANSPORTATION 
04:02:28 AND OTHER PEOPLE WERE SERVING ON 
04:02:33 THE LEGISLATURE WE THIS HAD TO FINISH 
04:02:34 HERE WE HAVE A TRANSPORTATION 
04:02:37 PROBLEM SO WE'RE ACTUALLY FIGURING OUT 
04:02:38 HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT 
04:02:45 WILL UNLOCK TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES 
04:02:46 AFTER 3 YEARS AND 52 MEETINGS 
04:02:52 EVERY STACK WILL PROVIDE AND IMPROVE. 
04:02:53 NOW IN THE LAST 6 YEARS THIS 
04:03:05 CITY BEEN THE NUMBER ONE CITY IN NORTH 
04:03:06 AMERICA. WE DON'T TAKE MONEY 
04:03:13 FROM RUSSIA AND HOT MONEY FROM CHINESE 
04:03:14 THANK GOD AND NOT MONEY FROM 
04:03:21 LATIN AMERICA BUT TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT 
04:03:22 AND CREATE JOBS AND 
04:03:26 OPPORTUNITIES. AND IF ALL OF A SUDDEN 
04:03:27 CHICAGO PUTS UP A SIGN SAYING 
04:03:34 WE'RE GOING TO BE LIKE NEW YORK AND SAN 
04:03:35 FRANCISCO AND SEALED WE WON'T 
04:03:38 GET THOSE INVESTMENT BECAUSE IT IS A 
04:03:39 WORLDWIDE MARKET IF YOU WANT TO 
04:03:44 SOLVE THE PROBLEMS ABOUT AFFORDABLE 
04:03:45 HOUSING YOU NEED TO STAY AND LIVE 
04:03:48 IN THE CITY AND GIVE THE KIDS AND 
04:03:49 FAMILIES AN INVESTMENT OR MAKE 
04:03:52 INVESTMENT IN TRANSPORTATION YOU NEED 
04:03:53 TO GROW OUR ECONOMY AND CREATE 
04:03:56 JOBS. AND THEN WHAT YOU DO UNLIKE YEARS 
04:03:57 PAST USE THAT GROWTH AND USE 
04:04:03 THE ABILITY TO GROW IN A CITY WITH JOBS 
04:04:04 TO BECOME A WAY YOU CAN'T FIND 
04:04:10 DO RESOURCES ADDRESS ALL THE ISSUES 
04:04:11 WITH THE TASK FORCE AND OTHERWISE 
04:04:18 YOU CAN GET CUT, POLICE AND FIRE AND 
04:04:19 GARBAGE SERVICES IT IMPACTS BOTH. 
04:04:31 I HAPPEN TO THINK WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY 
04:04:32 OVER THE YEARS ASTOUND GROW THE 
04:04:36 ECONOMY DO IT IN A BALANCED WAY TO FUND 
04:04:37 ALL THE DEVELOPMENT WE FACE 
04:04:43 AND THE OPPORTUNITIES. THIS IS AN 
04:04:44 JUDGMENT THAT ALSO CREATE THOUSANDS 
04:04:49 AND THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN THE ECONOMY IN 
04:04:50 THE VERY NEIGHBORHOOD YOU WANT 
04:04:54 GOOD MANUFACTURING JOBS THAT ARE COMING 
04:04:55 BACK TO THE CITY. THIS IS A 
04:05:00 STEP FORWARD IN THAT PROCESS NOT THE 
04:05:01 END OF PROGRESS I LOOK FORWARD TO 
04:05:05 CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU TO 
04:05:06 MAKE SURE IT HAPPENS. WITH THAT,
